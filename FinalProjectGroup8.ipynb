They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called \"automail\" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist. \r\n \r\nThree years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As a result, a prohibition on swords has been established, and the samurai of Japan are treated with disregard as a consequence. \r\n \r\nHowever one man, Gintoki Sakata, still possesses the heart of the samurai, although from his love of sweets and work as a yorozuya, one might not expect it. Accompanying him in his jack-of-all-trades line of work are Shinpachi Shimura, a boy with glasses and a strong heart, Kagura with her umbrella and seemingly bottomless stomach, as well as Sadaharu, their oversized pet dog. Of course, these odd jobs are not always simple, as they frequently have run-ins with the police, ragtag rebels, and assassins, oftentimes leading to humorous but unfortunate consequences. \r\n \r\nWho said life as an errand boy was easy? \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

         "The seemingly ordinary and unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby: being a hero. In order to pursue his childhood dream, he trained relentlessly for three years—and lost all of his hair in the process. Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored. \r\n  \r\nThis all changes with the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be Saitama's disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to society, and Saitama, shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And thus begins the story of  One Punch Man , an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he'll become popular in the process. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

         "The Free Planets Alliance's invasion of the Galactic Empire has failed after supply mismanagement led to heavy losses. Unwilling to abort the expedition despite being greatly outnumbered, Fleet Admiral Lazar Lobos orders the remaining Alliance fleets to gather in the Amritsar Starzone for a final stand against the incoming counterattack. \r\n \r\nStrategic genius Fleet Admiral Reinhard von Lohengramm leads the Imperial forces into this decisive battle with an overwhelming advantage. However, his rival, tactical magician Vice Admiral Yang Wen-li of the Alliance, once again makes up for the incompetence of his superiors and stages a narrow escape for himself and his fellow soldiers. Though both Reinhard and Yang are displeased with the outcome—the former for his imperfect victory and the latter for the tremendous casualties—their attention must turn to the bubbling political unrest on both sides of the galaxy. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

(Sagittarius)\nBlood Type: A\nNationality: Britannian\nHeight: 178 cm (5'10\")\nWeight: 56 kg (123 lbs)\nOccupation: Student, Terrorist, Knightmare Pilot, Politician, Emperor, Prince\nAllegiance: Order of the Black Knights\nPosition: Leader of the Black Knights\nKnightmare: Sutherland, Burai, Gawain, Shinkirou\n\nLelouch vi Britannia (ルルーシュ・ヴィ・ブリタニア, Rurūshu Vui Buritania) is the main protagonist of the anime/manga series Code Geass. He is the Eleventh Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire and the son of the 98th Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia.\n\nLelouch is a very clever individual who is also calm, sophisticated, and arrogant due to his aristocratic upbringing. While at school, Lelouch conducts himself as a friendly, likable, and often an easygoing student. However, this is a mask to hide his true nature. While as Zero, his true nature is expressed. His charisma and beliefs in justice gain him the trust and respect of many soldiers and leaders.\n\nHe is known for having a very stoic personality. He never cared about schoolwork, seeing the entire thing as trivial, even though his high intelligence would make it easy for him. He enjoys seeking out challenges, often playing chess against the nobility. In general, Lelouch takes most day-to-day affairs with open disinterest, often not even noticing the affection of others, especially Shirley, his classmate. He has a strong dislike for nobles, viewing them as tepid and \"overprivileged parasites.\"\n\nMany characters have noted that Lelouch is entirely selfish, as his desire to remake the world into what he wants it to become from his desire to avenge his mother's apparent death and Nunnally's sake. However, in time, he realizes that this goal is not just for them but also the entire world.\n\nDespite his cold, calculating demeanor and ruthlessness in battle, he can be a rather compassionate person to his friends and loved ones. To Nunnally, he is a loving older brother, and to Suzaku, a loyal friend, although the two are enemies. Lelouch, at first glance, seems to have relatively little concern for the well-being of his subordinates, but in reality, he does care about them, seeing them as valuable allies.\n\n\nCharacter Background (as Lelouch):\n\nCharacter Background (as Zero):\n\nFirst Season:\n\nSecond Season:\n\n\nGeass:\nLelouch's Geass, bestowed upon him by C.C., gives him \"The Power of Absolute Obedience,\" allowing him to plant commands within a person's mind upon eye contact in a manner comparable to hypnosis. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass Sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated are written into the minds of the designated targets, the Sigil projecting him from his eye to theirs.\n\nOf all the Geass abilities in the series, Lelouch's has been explored the most and also seems to have the most restrictions, and side effects of any Geass introduced:(Source: Code Geass Wiki, Villains Wiki, Heroes Wiki, Anime and Manga Universe Wiki)",

He never shows his face to the world, instead of representing himself with a capital L in Cloister Black font. After meeting the Kira investigation team, he requests that the task force refers to him as Ryuzaki for discretion. The Kira investigation team never learns his true name.\n\nL's disheveled and languid appearance masks his great powers of deduction and insight. He tends to second-guess everything he is presented with and is extremely meticulous and analytical. He has several quirks such as preferring to crouch rather than sit, eating only sweet foods like desserts and fruits, and holding items very delicately. He stayed in England for five years, and during that time he was the champion in tennis for the England Junior Cup.\n\nL suggests that even though he eats only sweet foods, he remains underweight because the brain uses the most calories of any organ in the body. He also says that if he sits normally, his reasoning ability would drop 40%.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, Death Note Profiles)",

At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in a childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.\n\nLuffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young male hero/adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial \"D.\"\n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism, and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear is towards his grandfather, to the point that he is intimidated at the mere mention of him.\n\nLuffy never kills any of his enemies, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or beating them to a point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.\n\nLuffy's dream is to find the One Piece and become Pirate King. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks.",

Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style).This is achieved by using one katana in each hand and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his bandana, normally tied on the arm, on his head.\n\nThough not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood.\n\nZoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but, unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.\n\nZoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he's a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and determined.",

He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed's primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a \"hero of the people\" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn't seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al's suffering.\n\nEdward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4'11\"), however, his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed's ability to fight is not impaired and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.\n\nBorn to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward's first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad's formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dead mother back to life with the power of alchemy.\n\nEdward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. After they do, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi's intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool. \n\nThough instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the \"One is All, All is One\" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics of a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation.\n\nDevising a Human Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound.\n\nAlphonse and Edward were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God's domain and peeking at the Gate's vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al's soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Alphonse carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy's life.\n\nOn the night of the failed transmutation. Lt. Colonel Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang came to the Rockbell's in response to a letter that Edward and Alphonse had sent him in the mail asking about their Father. He was shocked at the fact that the two boys had tried human alchemy and survived, and informed them that they could become state alchemist and maybe one day find a way to return their bodies to the way they were. Desperate to get His younger brother's body back, Edward asked the Rockbells to give him prosthetic limbs called automail. Though they warned him the surgery would be painful, he said the pain was nothing compared to what his brother had given up. He only took a year to adapt to the automail at age 11 when it took most adults three years.",

When born, a powerful nine-tailed demon fox attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage, the leader of the Hidden Leaf Village, sealed the demon fox within Naruto's newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.\n\nDespite the Fourth Hokage's dying wish that Naruto be viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a Jinchuuriki) the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demon were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracized by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.\n\nNaruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Coy, raffish and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.\n\nVowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.\n\nIn all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.",

To add to his troubles, oppressive aliens have moved in to invade planet Earth. Gintoki works taking on odd jobs alongside two kids: Kagura and Shinpachi. In the Joui war, he was known as the \"White Devil\" (Shiroyasha) due to his silver hair and white clothing he wore in battle, which, combined with his impressive capabilities as a swordsman, made him famous among his comrades and struck fear in the hearts of the Amanto.\n\nGintoki has naturally permed silver hair, which he blames for his lacking love-life. He has a big crush on the TV's news weather girl, Ketsuno. In fact, to date, the only time he is seen to have blushed is when he tries to make use of Sadaharu and Ketsuno's dog to get a chance to talk to her.(Though he later does with Tsukuyo as well when she discovers him shopping) Though several female characters have shown an interest in Gintoki, he usually does not show any response and merely puts up with them as annoyances.\n\nGintoki has two major obsessions in life. He is obsessed with sweet food such as parfaits, ice cream and cakes. His second obsession is reading the manga anthology magazine Weekly Shounen Jump. (Which, not coincidentally, is where Gintama is published). Gintoki will go to great lengths to get the latest Jump issue, to the point of reckless behavior. His Jump obsession makes him dream of being like other Jump heroes, including wishing that he had a \"Bankai\" similar to the characters of Bleach.\n\nDespite his appearance and initial behavior, Gintoki has a great amount of pride for the old bushido code. He takes it upon himself to rescue or avenge not only his comrades and friends but also people he's barely acquainted with, be it a pit-fighter who was taking care of abandoned orphans or an Amanto who resembles a kappa.\n\nDespite being a fearsome fighter with nearly unmatched skills, he avoids needless bloodshed after suffering the loss of most of his friends and allies during the Joui war.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, VS Battles Wiki, edited)",

Run, run and cling to life.\n\nBackground:\nItachi Uchiha is a missing-nin from Konohagakure, and a prominent member of Akatsuki, partnered with Kisame Hoshigaki. He is Sasuke Uchiha's older brother. \n\nItachi is relatively popular among many fans of Naruto, often having ranked in the top ten in Shonen Jump magazine's popularity polls since his introduction. He was first ranked in the third character popularity poll ranked in 11th place. He was ranked 9th place during the fourth popularity poll, and 6th place in the fifth popularity poll. During the sixth popularity poll, he again was ranked in 11th place. In the last poll, he was ranked in 5th place.\n\nItachi was born into the Uchiha clan and was praised by all as the best of his generation - a genius above all others. Even by the standards of the battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi's prowess far outshined all others. However, not even his family, friends, or teachers could understand him. When he was only 4, Itachi had already witnessed countless lives lost due to the Third Great Shinobi World War, which emotionally traumatized him and turned him into a pacifist. At age 7, he graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class after only one year, mastered the Sharingan at age 8, passed the Chunin Exams at age 10, and became ANBU Captain at age 13. According to Madara Uchiha, Itachi also had a lover, whom he killed during the Uchiha clan massacre.\n\nHe was praised highly by his father, who saw the family's future in Itachi, hence neglecting his other son - Itachi's younger brother, Sasuke. However, during this time Itachi showed great affection towards his little brother, Sasuke, and even encouraged his father to come to the Academy when Sasuke was enrolled, something their dad had otherwise forgotten, by saying that he would not go to an important mission, that would establish Itachi a place in the ANBU ranks, otherwise.\n\n\nPersonality:\n\nAs a member of Akatsuki, he possessed incredible self-control of his emotions. He constantly displayed an emotionless personality. He only showed surprise when opponents proved more powerful or skilled than he had expected, and even then he didn't lose his composure. He did not possess any arrogance, and fully justified any statements he made about his power, even complimenting his opponents at times on their abilities.\n\nIn addition to being an extremely powerful ninja, Itachi had equally impressive intelligence, and was shown to be very wise. He was exceedingly sharp and observant to any situation at hand, as he was rarely surprised or caught off guard. He also displayed great intuition, as he was almost never deceived and even then almost instantly realized the truth. Despite his status as a wanted criminal, and having murdered a significant portion of his family, Itachi took no enjoyment in violence or combat, instead preferring to avoid battle or, if this was not possible, end it as quickly as he could.\n\nItachi's only initial interest was in Akatsuki's goals, and his only loyalties appeared to be to the organization and its members, seeming to put the organization's success and secrecy before everything else. As such, Itachi got along with his partner, Kisame, much better than most other Akatsuki members did with their own partners. Kisame appeared to have a deep loyalty to Itachi, immediately doing as he instructed and constantly looking out for his well-being. Itachi treated all of his fellow Akatsuki members to this same, more respectful personality, although his courtesy was rarely returned by the other members.\n\n\nDespite his status as an infamous shinobi, his appearance was not the most intimidating, apart from the intensity of his eyes. While living in Konoha, he would regularly have a gentle and caring look in his eyes, especially directed towards his younger brother. After joining Akatsuki, he would regularly have a stern look to them. He was a fairly tall shinobi, whose basic appearance was very much like the rest of his clan.\n\nHe, like all members of his clan, possessed dark grey eyes, and also had black hair that hung near his cheeks to frame his face. He also had the addition of a long ponytail in the back of his hair (which he obscured with his Akatsuki cloak after joining the organization). Being brothers, Itachi and Sasuke had a similar appearance, but with subtle differences. Itachi's hair color appeared slightly duller and with a softer flow to it, without the spiky style at the back. His skin was also slightly darker. Itachi's most distinguishing characteristics were the long pronounced creases under his eyes.\n\nWhen he lived in Konoha, his casual clothes would consist of a black shirt with a large Uchiha clan symbol on the back of it, and black pants with a weapons pouch strapped to them. When on duty, he would wear the traditional ANBU uniform, although he was never shown wearing a mask. As a member of Akatsuki, he wore the traditional Akatsuki cloak, and usually kept the center of it buttoned down. After his cloak was incinerated by Sasuke's Kirin during their fight in Part II, it was revealed that he still wore his casual clothes underneath it. Like almost all members of Akatsuki, he wore the headband of his home village, Konoha, with a line gouged through it, to symbolize his broken ties with the village \nAbilities:\nSince a young age, Itachi's intellect and talent showed their brilliance in everything he did, as even his teachers said his progress hardly required any help. In the few battles he had been seen in since the start of the series, Itachi was shown to be an incredibly powerful ninja, and easily one of the strongest in the Naruto series, as demonstrated by his ability to easily defeat Deidara, Sasuke, Kakashi Hatake, Kurenai Yuhi and Orochimaru (twice), who themselves are considered amongst the strongest ninjas in Naruto. Being a pacifist, Itachi did not actively take part in battle, typically only acting in self-defense.\n\nSharingan:\nBeing of the Uchiha Clan, and as noted by Kakashi, Itachi was a true successor of the Sharingan Eye. From a stationary position, he would study an opponent's movements with his Sharingan and respond accordingly, often with a genjutsu. He could cast a genjutsu by merely pointing at or looking at someone, and could similarly turn an opponent's genjutsu against them with Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and Earth Change. Itachi had trained so much with his eyes that he had reached the stage where he could have his Sharingan activated the entire time, with minimal drain on his chakra levels. \n\nMangekyo Sharingan:\nItachi possessed the Mangekyo Sharingan, which increased his already great power, and enabled him to use his most powerful techniques. With his left eye, he could use Tsukuyomi, a genjutsu that traps an opponent's mind in an illusionary world, torturing them for what seems like days in a matter of seconds.With his right eye he could use Amaterasu, a ninjutsu which allowed him to create a black flame that he could direct by moving his eye to burn through seemingly anything in its path, including fire itself. His final technique was Susanoo, a technique that manifested itself as a spectral being, labelled as the \"Raging God of Battle\" in the databook. It wielded the Totsuka Sword, an ethereal sword with the ability to seal anything it pierces into the gourd that serves as its hilt, and Yata's Mirror, a shield that can reflect any attack. Zetsu, a fellow Akatsuki member, stated that Itachi's mastery of the Sharingan, combined with the legendary weapons of Susanoo, made him invincible.\n\n\n(Source: Naruto.com, Naruto Wikia)",

A doctor of the name Kanou, who secretly experiments with ghouls, humans, and half-ghouls, transplants what Kaneki believes to be a kidney into his body as a means of saving his life in the dire situation. Soon he learns that he had part of Rize's kagune transplanted into him, becoming the first of many human-ghoul experiments Kanou will conduct.\n\nDue to the unnatural abundance of RC Cells now present in his body because of Rize's kagune, Kaneki loses the ability to stomach human food, often getting sick or vomiting when ingesting any, and gains the powers of regeneration and kagune usage as a result. Because of his morals and attachment to humanity, Kaneki refuses to consume human beings as a means to sustain himself, even when the meat is obtained through non-violent means, rather he consumes large amounts of coffee, and, when absolutely necessary, will cannibalize other ghouls.\n\nLater, he joins with several ghouls, Banjou and Tsukiyama Shuu, in order to reduce the number of ghouls that cause havoc in the world to make the lives of humans better.

         "Age: 26–27 (Part I); 29–31 (Part II)\nBirthday: September 15\nHoroscope: Virgo\nBlood type: O\nHeight: 5\"11\"\nWeight: 67.5 kg \nHair: Silver\nEyes: Grey, Sharingan\nRank: Jonin, Former ANBU\nLikes: Icha-Icha series, Broiled Saury with salt, Miso soup with eggplant\nDislikes: Anything sweet\nQuote: (from Obito) \"A shinobi who violates the rules is scum, but a shinobi who abandons their friends is worse than scum.\"\n\nMajor Background Spoilers\n\nKakashi has an ongoing, albeit slightly one-sided, rivalry with Might Guy, with Guy constantly proclaiming that Kakashi is his rival, and considering his and Kakashi's subordinates rivals. Kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and Kakashi has acquired a record of 49 wins and 50 losses in doing so. Given that the contests that make up this figure are so varied (ranging from Rock, Paper, Scissors to sumo-wrestling), this is not much of an achievement on Guy's part. Nevertheless, Guy is proud of his record.\n\nThough he evasively says that he has \"many hobbies\" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of \"Icha Icha Paradise\" (イチャイチャパラダイス, Icha Icha Paradaisu, literally \"Make Out Paradise\"), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by Jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the Naruto world. Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, \"Icha Icha Violence\" (イチャイチャバイオレンス, Icha Icha Baiorensu, literally \"Make Out Violence\"). In Part II Naruto gives him the new \"Icha Icha Tactics\" (イチャイチャタクティクス, Icha Icha Takutikusu, literally \"Make Out Tactics\").\n\nKakashi's Sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent's movements flawlessly. Because it is a transplanted eye, his Sharingan eye is always active. While this would not be much of a problem for an Uchiha, his non-Uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. Because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles. Kakashi's use of the Sharingan is as good as that of Itachi Uchiha, though the aforementioned handicaps brought about by the nature of his eye make him somewhat weaker in comparison. In Part II Kakashi is able to develop his own Mangekyo Sharingan. With his variant he is able to manipulate space-time to conduct long range attacks, and in its two uses has been capable of severing another's arms and otherwise sending things to different dimensions. Much like the standard Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan tires Kakashi considerably, and after using it only three times he was hospitalized for a week due to its chakra usage.\n\nWith his Sharingan Kakashi has been able to copy more than one thousand jutsu, giving him the nickname \"Copy Ninja Kakashi\". As a result, Kakashi's arsenal most prominently features ninjutsu abilities and has led to him becoming a specialist in the field. Many of the jutsu he has been seen copying in the series are water-based attacks, though most of these he only uses against the person he copies them from. He does, however, use Water Release: Water Encampment Wall on occasion as a way to block attacks. He less frequently uses other elemental attacks such as Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique to attack opponents or Earth Release: Inner Decapitation Technique (土遁・心中斬首の術, Doton: Shinjū Zanshu no Jutsu, Viz \"Groundhog Technique Decapitation\", English TV \"Headhunter Jutsu\") to pull opponents below ground and immobilize them. He can also create shadow clones, though because he lacks Naruto's chakra reserves, he exercises the ability with caution, rarely creating more than one at a time.\n\nWhile Kakashi specializes in the use of ninjutsu due to his Sharingan he is fairly adept with other jutsu types, though his use of them is rarely seen. Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique (魔幻・奈烙見の術, Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu) causes his opponent to see what they would find a horrifying vision, keeping them preoccupied until they can overcome the illusion. A Thousand Years of Pain (death in english dub) (千年殺し, Sennen Goroshi) consists of Kakashi forcefully plunging his index and middle fingers into an opponent's rectum. While only capable of launching the opponent humorous distances in typical uses, the fingers can be replaced with kunai attached with exploding tags to actually do damage to the person one is attacking.\n\nWhen he was younger, Kakashi was taught how to use the Rasengan by the Fourth Hokage. Because the Rasengan is meant to have the user's chakra nature mixed with it, Kakashi attempted to add his lightning-based chakra to it, though was ultimately unsuccessful. In time he instead created the Chidori, his only original jutsu. After the jutsu's initial creation, Kakashi was unable to use the Chidori to its full potential as the sheer speed of the attack left his normal eyes unable to see any form of an enemy counterattack. After acquiring the Sharingan, however, he was able to overcome this shortcoming. Through repeated use and increased proficiency with it, Kakashi's Chidori has been upgraded and renamed to the Lightning Blade due to him having cut through a bolt of lightning with it.",

The inspiration for Spike is found in martial artist Bruce Lee who uses the martial arts style of Jeet Kune Do as depicted in Session 8, \"Waltz For Venus\". He has fluffy, dark green hair (which is inspired by Yusaku Matsuda's) and reddish brown eyes, one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III inspired boots. A flashback in Session 6 revealed it was his fully functioning right eye which was surgically replaced by the cybernetic one (although Spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an \"accident\"). One theory is that his natural eye may have been lost during the pre-series massacre in which he supposedly \"died\". The purpose of this cybernetic eye is never explicitly stated, though it apparently gives him exceptional hand-eye coordination - particularly with firearms (Spike's gun of choice is a Jericho 941, as seen throughout the series). In the first episode, when facing a bounty-head using Red Eye, Spike mocks him, calling his moves \"too slow\". At first, this seems like posturing on Spike's part, but even with his senses and reflexes accelerated to superhuman levels by the drug, the bounty cannot even touch Spike. A recurring device throughout the entire show is a closeup on Spike's fully-natural left eye before dissolving to a flashback of his life as part of the syndicate. As said by Spike himself in the last episode, his right eye \"only sees the present\" and his left eye \"only sees the past.\" Spike often has a bent cigarette between his lips, sometimes despite rain or \"No Smoking\" signs.",

She is a notable actress/model and a third year at Minegahara High School, the same school as Sakuta Azusagawa.\n\nMai is a serious individual, especially around Sakuta Azusagawa. She is very sensitive, polite, levelheaded, helpful, and kind. She isn't harsh by default, but she can become easily annoyed and come across as somewhat snappy or violent especially to Sakuta. Mai tends to ignore and stuff down unpleasant feelings rather than deal with them. Sakuta often points out that she is \"dishonest\", often lying about her feelings. Despite her snarkiness, she's pure-hearted and even shy around Sakuta's jokes. Mai is also very intelligent; she's implied to have very good grades and even helps Sakuta study at one point. \n\nMai found early fame as a model for television, magazines, and books due to the fact that her mother ran a photographing agency. While she did enjoy her job as a model in the show business, the pressure of being in the public began to take its toll on her. After being tricked and forced to participate in a swimsuit photoshoot by her mother in her early school years, Mai realized she was simply being used as a tool to make her mother easy money and took a hiatus from acting as a way to get back at her, deciding to attend highschool. \n\nHowever, because of work commitments made prior to her decision to go on hiatus she wasn't able to attend school until half-way through her first year. By then, social circles had formed, making her the \"odd one out\" and causing her to be isolated. As a result, the student body didn't know how to deal with her; While they had no reason to bully her, they also feared associating with her would cause themselves to be isolated as well.\n\n\n\nTwo years and several months since beginning her hiatus, Mai went to a library wearing a bunny costume to see if anyone would notice her. She then came across a boy named Sakuta Azusagawa, who was the only person in the building able to see her. After introducing themselves, however, Mai ordered Sakuta to forget about her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Seishun Buta Yarou Wiki)",

Due to her often snapping at others in brutal ways and her short stature, she is given the nickname \"Palmtop Tiger.\"\n\nHer under-developed body and the added nickname has given her a complex which in turn serves to give her a negative attitude and facial expression.

Ryuuji finds out due to a misplaced empty love letter from Taiga meant for Kitamura. Ryuuji then admits to having feelings for Taiga's best friend Minori. Due to this, Taiga and Ryuuji team up to help each other get into a relationship with each other's best friend.",

         "Birthday: August 3, 1975\n\nA 22-year-old, hormonal, blonde-haired biker and virgin, Onizuka Eikichi graduated from a bottom-rung university by cheating and, as such, cannot get a decent job. His main way of spending time is peering up girls' skirts in a local mall. He is very athletic, as he can bench press 150 kg (331 lbs), has a second dan black belt in karate, and even claims to perform 500 push-ups, 1000 pull ups and 2000 squats daily.\n\nThrough the events explained in the Great Teacher Onizuka manga, Onizuka decides to become a teacher, even though it is later implied that he has an IQ of about 50 (Though not necessarily true). His initial teacher training is in the Musashino Public High School, where he meets Nanako Mizuki. His experience taming the rowdy gangs in his assigned class hardens his convictions that teaching is the way to go, and when he learns of Mizuki's problems, he also decides to abstain from sexual experience with his students, opting to solve their personal issues for them, instead.\n\nUnfortunately, he nearly messes up by forgetting to take the public teachers' civil service exam. As a result, no public high school will take him, but he is still eligible for a number of private schools. He manages to get a job at the upper-crust Holy Forest Academy, despite the objections of vice-principal Uchiyamada Hiroshi, whom he continues to aggravate well into his tenure. Of course, one of the conditions of having the job at Holy Forest is that he must sleep at the school—in the storage room at the top floor, with roof access—and it is here that Onizuka officially starts his career in teaching, when he stops Yoshikawa Noboru from committing suicide.\n\nOnizuka is put in charge of class 3-4, a class so bad it has already driven several teachers insane. Not only does he survive the class's brutal bullying tactics, but he also befriends his students, and the backbone to the story of Great Teacher Onizuka consists of his unique experiences in turning his students around and learning lessons of his own.\n\nIt is later implied again, during the National Exams, that Onizuka might actually be some sort of genius. His exam results were swapped: once for full marks, and once for just short of full marks. However, when Yoshito Kikuchi is asked whether he is curious about Onizuka's true results, he checks the answers himself and the result amazes him. He checks with Onizuka, who states that he definitely got perfect results from his own effort (which would be incredible, since he did a 5 hour exam in 1 hour, bleeding, and having 4 bullets in his stomach).\n\nOnizuka has incredible physical resilience. On more than one occasion, he has fallen from heights that would instantly kill most people and claims to have a sort of healing factor, as he healed from a broken arm in less than a day, and even endure multiple gunshot wounds, in a short period of time. Onizuka often presents his strength in unintentionally flamboyant ways, such as arm wrestling over 100 men of exponential strength in a row and winning (including the character Heihachi from the Tekken series of fighting games, and Jason Voorhees from the films called Friday the 13th (series)). His fighting abilities are not to be taken lightly either, as Onizuka is capable of fending off multiple opponents, even if they are well-armed, and almost never receives any physical damage.\n\nIn spite of his impressive fighting skills, Onizuka is often roughed up by his students, and others, whenever he behaves badly. It could be speculated that deep down, Onizuka knows when he's acting immature, and allows others to keep him in line. An example of this is when he forces his students to dig the earth for buried treasure during the Okinawa trip. Kanzaki Urumi kicks Onizuka into a hole, and later forces him to wear S&amp;M garb and has him crawl around on all fours, with Urumi riding on his back. Yet another example is when Principal Uchiyamada has Onizuka over for dinner and hits him upside the head with a wooden bench after finding out that Onizuka was acting a bit of a letch with his daughter one day (Onizuka was playing \"where's the nipple\" with his daughter, at a karaoke bar in town).\n\nHis personal mode of transportation is a Kawasaki Z2 motorcycle 750cc type S. The bike itself is also featured heavily in the prequel series to GTO.",

Yukiteru's condition and actions are recorded every ten minutes in her \"Yukiteru\" diary, it also provides small commentary made by Yuno in some of the entries. Its most obvious weakness is that it does not show Yuno's future at all—her condition, situation, or surroundings—unless it somehow involves Yuki. Working with Yukiteru's \"Random Diary\" diary, however, covers both of their diaries' individual flaws; as it has been said the two make for a perfect combo.\n\nSmart, beautiful and diligent—those who don't truly know Gasai Yuno would simply see the model student role she plays while at school. She is secretly obsessed with Yukiteru and would do anything within her power to assist him. She can be quite clingy and is highly fond of stalking him. When obstacles arise that either endangers Yukki's life or threatens their relationship, her thoughts turn murderous and she lets nothing get in the way of her path. Yuno is also able to quickly analyze and adapt to unexpected situations that may arise, and she puts thoughts into action without hesitation, performing what needs to be done without ever losing her nerves. These traits make her one of the strongest players in Deus's game, despite having one of the weakest diaries for providing self survival aid. And while Yukiteru is credited for triggering the greatest shift in future occurrences, Yuno is the one who has created the largest influence in those events. Yuno tends to carry around a box cutter with her at all times, though she will make use of other weaponry such as kitchen knives, hatchets, etc, when required.\n\n\nShe is named after Juno (pronounced yu-no in Latin), the Roman goddess of Motherhood and Femininity.",

He can see in the dark, his eyes turn red when he gets angry, and he heals incredibly fast. As a result, he questions his lifespan. He remains scared of morning sunlight despite the fact that it no longer has any negative effects on him.\n\nKoyomi is a laid-back person whose only real friend at school is Tsubasa Hanekawa. He's a poor student, close to failing every class except math.\n\nIt is revealed through conversations that he's quite knowledgeable with anime; a fact even noted by Nadeko Sengoku once.\n\nAlthough he is shown to be attracted to the other girls, he turns their advances down due to his loyalty to Hitagi.\n\nOther characters seems to speculate that Koyomi is a lolicon, particularly Mayoi and Hitagi, with Hitagi thinking that Nadeko is a \"threat\" to her.\n\nHe is very noble, which is why Hitagi is attracted to him. He is willing to help others at the cost of his own life. As such, the female characters he has helped are quite attached to him.

He is a fairly tall, and lean-built person with peach skin and brown eyes. Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears standard Shinigami attire with the addition of a strap across his chest.\n\nWhen he was young, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world. Ichigo always smiled whenever he was with Masaki and he was regularly at her side, holding her hand.\n\nAs a teenager, Ichigo's personality is much more complex. Stubborn, short-tempered, occasionally confrontational, determined, outspoken, strong-willed and impulsive, he attempts to maintain a detached and \"cool\" image, despite claiming to not care about what other people think about him. He generally keeps his face set in a permanent scowl with his eyebrows drawn together. Ichigo carries the burden of the real world and the spirit world (Soul Society), a task quite difficult, especially for a teenager like Ichigo, who has his own worries and problems. Also, Ichigo is quite smart; he was ranked 23rd in his high school. He does this partly to prove to his teachers and classmates that just because he's unique, or somewhat punkish, that he can still succeed.\n\nWhen Ichigo first becomes a Shinigami, his Zanpakutō is a standard-looking katana, but oversized with an equally-oversized brown sheathe hung by a strap over his right shoulder. It has a rectangular bronze hand guard with gently inward-curved edges, a stylized flame pattern on the long sides, and a simple decorative slit on the short ones. The handle is red with two light blue tassels on the end of the handle. The large size is due to the unfocused but immense amount of Ichigo's spiritual power, which he didn't know how to control. As a result, the sword itself was rather weak, since very little spiritual power was used to create it. Nevertheless, it was powerful enough to subdue a Gillian-class Menos and lesser Hollows, completely blocking a Cero from the former. It was even able to upturn the ground with a single strike. Because of its weak spiritual energy nature, Byakuya Kuchiki was able to easily cut off most of the blade during his first encounter with Ichigo and Kisuke Urahara subsequently slices it down to the hilt during their training, forcing Ichigo to learn the name of his Zanpakutō in order to release its true form. This sword is found to be a result of Rukia's deprived spiritual energy and not a result of his own power.",

With his parents and family now gone, his brother spared him and left him to survive by himself. He told Sasuke to hate him. Sasuke tried to forget about the past by applying himself in the ninja academy and fitting in with the rest of the leaf village.\n\nAfter his fight with Naruto, he believes he's been wasting his time \"playing ninja\" with the people of the leaf village. His new goal is to get stronger so he can avenge his clan by killing Itachi and then restore the Uchiha clan.\n\nAs a wielder of the Sharingan (the kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan), he learns to use Chidori and has a vast knowledge of the various Fire Jutsus. The curse seal which Orichimaru gives him during the Chuunin exam, at first, enhanced his power but at the risk of killing him. Now he can use it of his own free will.\n\nClaiming at first that he doesn't need any friends, he is forced to contradict himself when he sees that either Naruto or Sakura are in danger. Remembering this type of Sasuke is what brings motivation to Naruto. Sasuke openly admitted to Naruto that he was his closest friend.\n\nAppearance\nSasuke has black hair with a blue tint that lengthens as the story goes with onyx eyes and has lighter skin than his brother Itachi. Like many other members of his clan, his hair hangs over both sides of his face to roughly his cheeks. In his curse seal form, he has grey skin with wings on his back that resemble giant webbed hands. He also has hair similar to Madara Uchiha except in a greyish-blue color.\n\nAt the beginning of Part I, Sasuke's clothing made up a blue, short-sleeved shirt with a raised collar and the Uchiha crest on the back and white shorts. An interesting thing is that during Part I the Uchiha symbol on his back gets smaller each time he changes his outfit. In the last stage of the Chunin exams, he wore a black, one pieced version of this outfit but eventually went back to his original clothes.\n\nIn Part II, Sasuke has grown noticeably taller (almost eye height with Itachi) and slightly more muscular. wears a white long sleeved shirt that's open at the torso with a smaller version of the Uchiha crest on his collar. He wears black pants with a blue cloth hanging from his half way up his stomach to his knees. He also wears a purple rope belt (Japanese name: Shimenawa) tied in a bow fashion found on many Sound ninja, only the bow is in a different style and is tied in the front instead of the back. He also will at points remove his shirt and hang it from his belt around his waist to give his wings in Curse Seal Level 2 room to move (also without transforming).",

He has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his cooking skills. Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef \"Red Leg\" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue.\n\nSanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his \"love-cook\" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname \"ero-cook,\" or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around women, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can't attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a \"strict upbringing.\" To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur.\n\nHis goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.\n\nBeing the crew's chef, he looks out for the health of his crewmates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He's also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well. In short, he cares as much for the crew as any Straw Hat should, but unlike Zoro, Sanji shows these feelings more.",

However, as time went on, the townspeople slowly started to forsake Holo and did not rely on her as they once did. As such, Holo escapes from town in Lawrence's wagon and started traveling with him to see how much the world has changed since she has been in Pasloe. Holo has chosen the form of a girl younger than Lawrence, though she still retains her large white-tipped wolf tail, and ears. Her true form is that of a very large wolf which many people revered and feared.\n\nShe refers to herself as the \"Wise Wolf of Yoitsu\" (ヨイツの賢狼). She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, though due to her isolation for hundreds of years in Pasloe, she gradually feels very lonely, and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself. She relies on Lawrence for company as she fears loneliness, which is something that Lawrence is very aware of and tries to comfort her in his own way. Holo is also very aware of the different time spans that she and Lawrence have, as a human lifespan is like a blink of an eye for her kind. Holo is quite scared of that fact, but hides it with jokes.

She is a silver-haired half-elf girl who is one of the candidates to become the next ruler in the royal election. Subaru first meets her when her insignia is stolen by Felt as she needs to possess it to be eligible to participate in the election. She introduces herself as Satella when she and Subaru met during the first timeline before introducing herself by her real name when she got her insignia back.\n\nEmilia is good natured and likes to take care of others, though she herself refuses to admit it, instead thinking of it as her own selfishness. She is indifferent to her own appearance, leaving Puck to take care of her clothes and hair. Because her appearance is similar to the Witch of Envy, she has received unfair discrimination from others. She sometimes acts like a child and is unacquainted with the world as she used to live in the woods with other Elves, though despite this she still works hard to become a ruler.",

         "In the year 2071, humanity has colonized several of the planets and moons of the solar system leaving the now uninhabitable surface of planet Earth behind. The Inter Solar System Police attempts to keep peace in the galaxy, aided in part by outlaw bounty hunters, referred to as \"Cowboys.\" The ragtag team aboard the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals. \r\n  \r\nMellow and carefree Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off course by the addition of new members that they meet in their travels—Ein, a genetically engineered, highly intelligent Welsh Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic trickster with memory loss; and the strange computer whiz kid Edward Wong—the crew embarks on thrilling adventures that unravel each member's dark and mysterious past little by little. \r\n \r\nWell-balanced with high density action and light-hearted comedy,  Cowboy Bebop  is a space Western classic and an homage to the smooth and improvised music it is named after. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, this routine is interrupted when Faye, who is chasing a fairly worthless target on Mars, witnesses an oil tanker suddenly explode, causing mass hysteria. As casualties mount due to a strange disease spreading through the smoke from the blast, a whopping three hundred million woolong price is placed on the head of the supposed perpetrator. \r\n \r\nWith lives at stake and a solution to their money problems in sight, the Bebop crew springs into action. Spike, Jet, Faye, and Edward, followed closely by Ein, split up to pursue different leads across Alba City. Through their individual investigations, they discover a cover-up scheme involving a pharmaceutical company, revealing a plot that reaches much further than the ragtag team of bounty hunters could have realized. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But soon, their misadventures evolve into life-or-death situations as a group of legendary assassins are summoned to bring about suffering to the trio. Vash's agonizing past will be unraveled and his morality and principles pushed to the breaking point. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While preparing to perform surgery on someone, he gets a call from the hospital director telling him to switch patients and instead perform life-saving brain surgery on a famous performer. His fellow doctors, fiancée, and the hospital director applaud his accomplishment; but because of the switch, a poor immigrant worker is dead, causing Dr. Tenma to have a crisis of conscience. \r\n \r\nSo when a similar situation arises, Dr. Tenma stands his ground and chooses to perform surgery on the young boy Johan Liebert instead of the town's mayor. Unfortunately, this choice leads to serious ramifications for Dr. Tenma—losing his social standing being one of them.

With no evidence to convict him, he is released and goes on to attain the position of hospital director.  \r\n \r\nNine years later when Dr. Tenma saves the life of a criminal, his past comes back to haunt him—once again, he comes face to face with the monster he operated on.

For those who have spent a little too long in the Kanto sun, the desert offers a wondrous opportunity to make a name for themselves. \r\n \r\nOne such person is the masked handyman \"Sunabouzu,\" or Desert Punk, who has forged a legendary reputation for always finishing his jobs, no matter the nature or cost. Cunning and ruthless, he has become a force of crude destruction to the other desert people. However, the \"Vixen of the Desert,\" Junko Asagiri, discovers that Sunabouzu is not without his weaknesses—he is easily swayed by his insatiable lust for large-breasted desert babes.  \r\n \r\nFollowing their chaotic adventures through the Kanto Desert,  Sunabouzu  features a bizarre cast of personalities who entertain themselves with senseless violence and perversion in a world long destroyed by their forefathers. And just like them, they have not learned a damn thing. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, in order for them to become more familiar with human society, a home-stay program has been enacted to allow them to mingle with other humans. \r\n \r\nOne misty morning, a truck carrying a capsule that housed one of these aliens ends up dropping it into the riverbank, releasing her from her confinement. She is eventually found by a high school student named Takeya Ikuhara, who saves her from being hit by a truck and takes pity on her, despite being extremely distrustful of their race and wanting nothing to do with them. Upon being named Ren, she imprints upon him as her \"Master\" and serves as his personal \"Slave,\" leaving him with a \"DearS\" who wants to remain with him no matter what and bringing his ordinary, alien-free days to an end.",

         "Traumatized by school, Jun Sakurada spends his days at home as a shut-in, purchasing things online, only to send them back before the free trial period ends. So when a note appears on his desk, asking whether or not he would wind something, he assumes it was something he ordered and carelessly circles \"yes,\" changing his life forever. \r\n  \r\nA box arrives with a wind up doll inside, but this is no ordinary toy: after Jun winds her up, she begins walking and talking as if a normal person. With a haughty attitude, she introduces herself as Shinku, the fifth doll in the Rozen Maiden collection, a group of special dolls made by the legendary dollmaker Rozen. These sisters must battle each other in a competition called the Alice Game with the help of a human to ensure victory. The winner becomes Alice, a real girl who is worthy of meeting their creator. \r\n \r\nAs more sentient dolls end up taking residence in Jun's house, and a foe from Shinku's past makes her appearance, Jun's life becomes far more complicated than he ever thought possible. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

         "As the story of  Rozen Maiden  closes, a new chapter begins in  Rozen Maiden: Träumend . Shinku and the other sentient dolls of the Rozen Maiden collection are living life as usual at Jun Sakurada's house. Having settled into his role as Shinku's partner in the deadly Alice Game, Jun overcomes his former fears and prepares to return to school. And although Shinku and the other dolls idly pass the days by in the comfort of Jun's home, dark times lie ahead as a new foe presents herself: Barasuishou, the seventh Rozen Maiden. \r\n \r\nBut Barasuishou is a mystery even to her sisters, none of whom have ever laid eyes on her until now. Shinku considers this a sign that the Alice Game is coming to an end, meaning the dolls will soon be forced to fight one another. Haunted by the upcoming battle and nightmares concerning another doll, Shinku begins distancing herself from the others. If she wishes to claim victory, it will come at a high cost—the lives of her sisters. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

         "Chiyo Mihama begins her high school career as one of the strangest students in her freshman class—a tiny, 10-year-old academic prodigy with a fondness for plush dolls and homemade cooking. But her homeroom teacher, Yukari Tanizaki, is the kind of person who would hijack a student's bike to avoid being late, so \"strange\" is a relative word. \r\n \r\nThere certainly isn't a shortage of peculiar girls in Yukari-sensei's homeroom class. Accompanying Chiyo are students like Tomo Takino, an energetic tomboy with more enthusiasm than brains; Koyomi Mizuhara, Tomo's best friend whose temper has a fuse shorter than Chiyo; and Sakaki, a tall, athletic beauty whose intimidating looks hide a gentle personality and a painful obsession with cats. In addition, transfer student Ayumu Kasuga, a girl with her head stuck in the clouds, fits right in with the rest of the girls—and she has a few interesting theories about Chiyo's pigtails! \r\n \r\nTogether, this lovable group of girls experience the ups and downs of school life, their many adventures filled with constant laughter, surreal absurdity, and occasionally even touching commentary on the bittersweet, temporal nature of high school. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But when a ceasefire is ordered by the powerful warlord Ieyasu Tokugawa, the two clans are forced to put down their arms. \r\n \r\nYears later, Gennosuke Kouga, heir of the Kouga clan, and Oboro Iga, heir of the Iga clan, have fallen in love. Through marriage, both heirs aim to bring peace to the clans. But their hopes are dashed when flames of rivalry between their clans are reignited, and they are dragged into another war. \r\n \r\nIeyasu's two grandsons have both claimed to be the next heir to the shogunate. To resolve this dispute, both the Kouga and Iga are ordered to send their 10 best warriors to fight in a bloody battle royale, with each clan representing one of the potential shogunate heirs. Two scrolls with the names of the fighters are given and are to be marked in blood upon the given fighter's death. The prize for winning is the favor of the Tokugawa shogunate for a thousand years. Torn between their love for each other and duty to their clans, Gennosuke and Oboro must ultimately decide the fate of their clans. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Deciding to abandon his role as the Black Cat, he instead opts to head down a virtuous path as an honest bounty hunter. However, Chronos—and particularly Creed Diskenth, Train's possessive underling—is not impressed with Train's sudden change of heart and vows to resort to extreme measures in order to bring back the emissary of bad luck. \r\n \r\nThis assassin turned \"stray cat\" can only wander so far before the deafening sound of gunfire rings out. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
