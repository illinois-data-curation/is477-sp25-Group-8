They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called \"automail\" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist. \r\n \r\nThree years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As a result, a prohibition on swords has been established, and the samurai of Japan are treated with disregard as a consequence. \r\n \r\nHowever one man, Gintoki Sakata, still possesses the heart of the samurai, although from his love of sweets and work as a yorozuya, one might not expect it. Accompanying him in his jack-of-all-trades line of work are Shinpachi Shimura, a boy with glasses and a strong heart, Kagura with her umbrella and seemingly bottomless stomach, as well as Sadaharu, their oversized pet dog. Of course, these odd jobs are not always simple, as they frequently have run-ins with the police, ragtag rebels, and assassins, oftentimes leading to humorous but unfortunate consequences. \r\n \r\nWho said life as an errand boy was easy? \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

         "The seemingly ordinary and unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby: being a hero. In order to pursue his childhood dream, he trained relentlessly for three years—and lost all of his hair in the process. Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored. \r\n  \r\nThis all changes with the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be Saitama's disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to society, and Saitama, shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And thus begins the story of  One Punch Man , an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he'll become popular in the process. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

         "The Free Planets Alliance's invasion of the Galactic Empire has failed after supply mismanagement led to heavy losses. Unwilling to abort the expedition despite being greatly outnumbered, Fleet Admiral Lazar Lobos orders the remaining Alliance fleets to gather in the Amritsar Starzone for a final stand against the incoming counterattack. \r\n \r\nStrategic genius Fleet Admiral Reinhard von Lohengramm leads the Imperial forces into this decisive battle with an overwhelming advantage. However, his rival, tactical magician Vice Admiral Yang Wen-li of the Alliance, once again makes up for the incompetence of his superiors and stages a narrow escape for himself and his fellow soldiers. Though both Reinhard and Yang are displeased with the outcome—the former for his imperfect victory and the latter for the tremendous casualties—their attention must turn to the bubbling political unrest on both sides of the galaxy. \r\n \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile. \r\n------ \r\n \r\nI'm going to keep this \"review\" more of a opinion of Gintama's overall and then this season specific. \r\n \r\nAnyhow. What I have always loved regarding Gintama, is its content of everything. I love the comedy, its absurd, random, can be vile, dirty, sweet, anyhow, everything. Have laughed countless times in this franchise. Also the humor they have also is heavily reference based, a.k.a parodies of different anime, shows, manga, live stuff, real world, anime production and so on. Anyhow, comedy/parody side of this franchise i absolutely love. \r\n \r\nNow, 2nd side of this show is the serious dramas, epic battle shounens and so on.. There are arcs that are fully comedy, arcs that are fully serious and mixtures of both. Serious side is usually quite dramatic and managed to somewhat tear me up now and then. Whilst the action sequences are absolute bliss as well. They are just presented in a really cool manner. And extra points when sometime the add artistic element. \r\n \r\nOf course it has its slice-of-life side and pseudo-romance. Those are weaker side, but ain't the focus. But when sometimes those are the \"focus\", then they are done in enjoyable method. \r\n \r\nTo sum up overall gintama's, I love the serious side and the silly side. \r\n \r\nArt and sound (voice acting/ost/op/ed) is something I loved in all gintamas across the board. They just click with me, bliss to look at, bliss to hear. Music (op/ed) specifically are hyped up and upbeat, which generally I don't like, but gintama is the exception where I love them. Art is cool, sometimes artistic, sometimes simple. It has a bit of everything that makes it enjoyable. And gore is absolutely satisfying as well. (well, the blood to be specific) \r\n \r\nWell, the serious side of stories in this anime are superb in my opinion. (or the overall idea of story that moves now and then). But wouldn't say comedic side of series story is any worse.  When at times comedy side has \"story\". It's usually quite enjoyable. \r\n \r\nRegarding characters I don't have much to say other than that variety, stereotypes of \"off-stereotypes\" is very large. As well characters with depth but as well with oddity is as well in great selection. Main team. Gintoki the lazy dirty slob with superb second side of seriousness and caring about friends/allies. Shinpachi the poor straight-man-act sidekick, who adds great value to the team. Kagura, the battle race girl that doesn't act like girl almost at all, or in another words a dirty slob girl in a sense. \r\n----------------- \r\n \r\nNow, to this season specific. \r\n \r\nI found it a bit disappointing. Mainly because usually in gintama we have overly serious arcs or fully comedic, whilst this one had a bit of mixture of both, which somewhat ruined the experience. Plus the artistic presentation felt this time around a bit lacking. Maybe because of another studio, who knows. But anyhow, it didn't feel as superb. Rather than gintama it felt as watching just another good battle shounen anime in modern day with simplified animation. \r\n \r\nI mean it definitely was not any bad, just didn't have the punch Gintama usually has. Might be because it was short series, maybe because it focused too much moving on with story. It'll be shame to see it finalized in this manner. \r\n \r\nRest I pretty much loved as usual in Gintama franchise.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

This may sound like I'm placing the series on a pedestal, and you could say that personal bias has influenced by decision to rate MIA a full 10/10 for all the components, but please allow me to try my best to break down and pinpoint just exactly why it has earned such a place in my heart.  \r\n \r\nBeginning with the first episode, which took me by serious surprise when I was left in absolute awe by the mystical vibes exuded by the astounding visuals and the beautiful soundtrack. MIA has one of the best first episodes I have ever seen thus far because unlike other shows where they bombard the audience with a complex plot in a desperate attempt to bait them into watching the rest of the show, MIA does that exact opposite. Instead, we tag along with our protagonist, Riko, and her adventures down into the abyss. Some things occur, and right off the bat, episode one was sufficient to leave me tense at the edge of my seat, yet the premise is simple and digestible enough for me to follow along. And at the end, we are treated with a stunning picturesque overview of the abyss, and that alone was enough to leave me desiring to be transported into their world and explore the abyss along with Riko. They had successfully pulled off their intended effect – to reproduce that sort of charm and mystery of the abyss, something that is so dangerous, slightly sinister, yet people, both the characters in MIA, along with the audience, are drawn to it.  \r\n \r\nMoving on to the crux of MIA, the plot. The first few episodes mask the true sinister reality of the show and I was tricked into thinking this would be a cute adventure series with Riko and friends, but boy does that completely change in the next few episodes to come. Now don’t get me wrong, being ‘dark’ or ‘deep’ doesn’t necessarily equate to a good compelling story, as plenty of shows that seek to achieve such an effect often go beyond their capacity and all that remains is simply a cringefest of wasted potential. Yet, MIA absolutely nails in its execution. Even in earlier parts where there was a lighter more upbeat tone, the story never got stale and it was just downright entertaining to witness the happenings and adventures of Riko and those around her. And now that I think about it, it wasn’t really the plot itself that was unique or fantastic, rather, it's the perfect pacing and storytelling the series chose to adopt that really sold the show to me. I would go so far as to say that MIA is somewhat like a deconstruction of adventure genres and how behind the excitement and thrill of going on a journey of never return, lies the harsh brutal reality, something that even 12 years olds are not immune to, and are in fact more prone to its effects due to their fragility.  \r\n \r\nI could not have asked for a better two main characters, Riko and Reg. One is an enthusiastic fearless adventurer and the other a shy yet fiercely protective friend. This iconic pair are extremely well written characters that spoke out to me on a profound level, weaving my emotional attachment towards them, and thus cue the tears and heartache when misfortune befell them. The complement and supplement each other in so many ways that it is just really darn endearing to see them interact. And due to spoiler reasons, I shall not delve deep into the third main character that only appears in the later episodes, but she, too, is absolutely precious and I honestly cherish the chemistry and relationships that they foster over the span of the series. Even side characters, including the most minor ones, and even ones that don’t even appear apart from through flashbacks and recollections, are memorable and they have that sense of quirkiness and originality that is in its own way a breath of fresh air after so many reused anime troupes that we have seen time and time again.  \r\n \r\nEvery single Friday for 13 weeks, this show was something that I really looked forward to. It was a spectacular journey and one that I am so happy I decided to start. It is absolutely magical and a feast for my eyes as with such a unique art style accompanied with the most detailed backgrounds. Every piece of music matched the scene so well and it was truly a beautiful symphony of sounds, visuals and storytelling. Thank you for reading my review of this Masterpiece and I hope that you will embark on the same journey as me and finish it with the same feelings as I did. :)  \r\n\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

However, there is no sound track that are memorable. Can't give it a higher score. \r\n \r\nCharacter 8/10: There are many very different characters. Most of them are real and believable. However, most characters are stereotypes and there is not much development. \r\n \r\nStory 7/10: Overall this is a pretty straight forward plot with some twists. However, the pacing is a bit slow until the last 4-5 episodes.  \r\n \r\nEnjoyment 8/10: Episode 23 and 24 are amazing 10/10. There are other moments that are great.  But outside of those, it was just good, 7/10. Overall 8. \r\n \r\nIn my own rating system, a perfect show gets 9/10. If a show strikes me hard emotionally or teach me something that change my life, then it goes another +1. This is a 7/10 show in my mind. Good overall, I may rewatch some episodes but I won't go out of my way to do it.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

\r\ntaking place 1 yr from where season 1 trailed off i really anticipated this series' return but was a bit disappointed by how everything seemed to restart just the way everything began with geass 1. the only difference is that the catching up isnt far off since lelouch already have that military might he didnt have when code geass began. aside from that, i was a bit disappointed with how geass 2 somewhat deviated itself from geass 1 in the sense that the focal issue of geass has been resolved within 2 episodes, leaving some other secrets about it uncovered making the series lose the &quot;essence&quot; of its title. \r\n \r\nif geass 2 was able to brag about something, it would be the world domination schema that would really perk up strategy gamers' interests. alliances and forged, countries are colored red or blue and the world was torn between factions. as a personal fan of strategy games, i considered this plot influence a plus. \r\n \r\n in the end, code geass 2 reverted to being another gundam series that ends with one massive war and a use of nukes/superweapons and i think that in itself made geass 2 unimpressive. however, it's overall flow was realistic. technology was discovered to counter an opposing country's technology. the world competed with one another through technology and development and that is another great influence of watching geass in the long run. it makes people realize that this overpowered mech came into realization in order to counter this other mech. \r\n \r\noverall, geass have been bluntly a strategic action anime. it could've been better if they involved geass too and put it much in detail but hey. it happened, the season ended and everyone watched. \r\n \r\nArt \r\n \r\nthe art is always good since it came from clamp but some angles would make me remember some SeeD characters such as kira and athrun. well it's all nice though but it's somewhat distracting since you're too much focused in the development of the story itself.  \r\n \r\nthe knightmares themselves were definitely stylish especially this time around. they featured much sleek and glossy coating that made me reminiscient of 00. there were also some knightmare designs that seemed to have been copied from Gundam 00 but i think that's plausible sincesunrise made both series. \r\n \r\nthere were also some episodes released with poor quality but regardless, geass 2 was still fun to watch. \r\n \r\nSound \r\n \r\nwith nakagawa kotaro responsible for the bgm heard all throughout, there is no way geass wouldn't stand out. the opening songs by orange range and flow were good but the ending theme with ali project is/has that weird, uneasy impact on me. though i did like AP when they did the rozen maiden series, it somehow doesnt fit geass. i also didnt like how the final ep ended in an ali project end. it somehow doesnt feel enough closure like how they decided to end it on s1. that or maybe im requesting too much \r\n \r\nCharacter \r\n \r\nthere were plenty of characters introduced this season as well as recurring ones. it seemed that every fanbase was influenced by geass such as lolicons, yaois, yuris, incest, and even some other unnamed weird bases. \r\n \r\naside from fanservice issues, im glad to see that a lot of the cast of geass have matured. from the young boy that wanted to make a world for her sister now fights for the rest of the world. the knight that holds his principles have finally decided to throw them away. there were lots of changes, both big and small, yet contributed to the development of the story. there were characters to raged at, to laugh at, to cry at and every last one of them contributed in the enjoyment of geass \r\n \r\nEnjoyment \r\n \r\naside from the return of overpowered mechas that does spinkicks and heeldrops, im amused the most on the display of wit and strategy that geass used all throughout. one thing that code geass dsitances itself from its gundam counterparts would be the sheer execution of strategy that does not rely heavily on a single unit's power. while lelouch continued to throw away lives, he made every sacrifice worth it. that virtue itself is something that would interest me in as how flawless strategies are executed and how and individual carries the burden of his choices.  \r\n \r\ndespite being given the power of geass, despite the actions taken and the decisions made, we also see the conflict of a young boy as he turned into a responsible man as he continued to carry the weight of his sins. as his influence grew and the hatred spread and how he finally resolved everything in one go. \r\n \r\nif there were some things that season 2 influenced me with, it must've been the weight of one's sacrifice and the growing up of one simple ideal into another. \r\n \r\nthe boy who fought for his own happiness in R1 now fought for the happiness of the world in R2 and that in itself is a good way to close things regarding lelouch's personal issues. \r\n \r\nas ive said however, lelouch's issue is over in this series but the issue about CC and geass is not. if there would be an s3 it woudl definitely be a new story and a new cast \r\n \r\nOverall \r\n \r\nit was fun, it was depressing, it brought me to tears and rage and awe and dissatisfaction. even though the beginning was a bit good and the middle was totally off, the end topped it off but it still left most hanging. still, it never ceases to amaze me how much wisdom lelouch has. you can blame it to his experience in R1 and the things he experienced in R2 but still, the experiences he had cultivated him to make a &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; triumphant plan in the end and that totally impressed me with code geass. \r\n \r\nif this is the end of this series then i would surely miss the cast and crew of code geass.  \r\n \r\nthis is a job well done but i wished that they made something along the series to make it better.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

It's about friendship, growing up, love and loss.  \r\n \r\nEverything about this anime is amazing, but if I have to say what is the best part about Clannad: After Story, It's it's characters. \r\n \r\nI think everyone would want a Tomoya as a husband, a Nagisa as a wife, an Akio as father-in-law, a Sanae as mother-in-law, Sunohara as your best friend, Mei as a little sister, Ushio as a daughter, Yoshino as a Colleague and in the end; even a Naoyuki as a father.  \r\n \r\nTomoya is a huge role model for me, how awful his life might get he still keeps going. He has shown me how huge of a wuss I am. He cries a lot in this anime and I dont think he is less manly for it(Since I cried with him).I really enjoy the types of leads that are sarcastic trolls and gentlemanlike at the same time(Like Yuuichi from Kanon), which can lead to very humorous but also very dramatic moments. \r\n \r\nSome people might think the ending makes no sense, and to those people i say(I can't stand them): Pay attention! \r\nThe anime gives hints to what is going to happen, Think of what happens after Tomoya helps Fuko, Kotomi, Yukine and Naoyuki but also the whole \"girl in the illusionary world\" arc. \r\nIn my opinion the ending beautifully ties everything together, with help of the amazing song: \"Chiisana Te No Hira\", which I still cannot listen without getting goosebumps. Which also gives a great ending to the story of the relationship between Tomoya and his dad Naoyuki. \r\n \r\nClannad has changed my look on life for ever, And therefore I give it a 10/10, and have reserved the 10/10 slot on MAL for the series and only this series, because It's a different level of masterpiece. \r\n \r\nI highly reccomend you watch it \r\n \r\n \n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

Being a girl, I never did like mecha animes, but somehow decided to give it a try. And I'm glad that I did, because this anime is simply a masterpiece! \r\n \r\nStory: The story was well planned, however it got a little rushed as the series went along. Despite that, the overall story is simply astounding. It got me hooked from the first episode and I finshed both R1 and R2 in 3 days. The plot twists and cliffhangers in every episode will leave you wanting much more it's hard to stop watching :D \r\n \r\nArt: As expected from CLAMP, the character designs was magnificent. The background and the machines were all drawn in great detail and did not disappoint me.y \r\n \r\nSound: Code Geass BGM was one of the best I've heard. The music really sets the mood, and you would still be listening to the music despite all the action going on! The voice actors were also well chosen. Jun's role as Lelouch was the best I've seen, though I never took much notice of him in Bleach (Yumichika). He really pulls off the different faces of Lelouch through voices alone! C.C.'s voice fits her perfectly too, giving off the mysterious feel. In all, great sound! \r\n \r\nCharacter: I like the way they portray the characters, showing that they do have weaknesses too, and not the IM INVINCIBLE YO mindless thinking. Enough to score for me. \r\n \r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed Code Geass as it was the first anime that could keep me hooked on it so long and made me think about the themes explored in the story. It really shook my opinion of what justice really is, etc.  \r\n \r\nOverall: A greeeeeeeeat anime! The mechas are there to help the story proceed, the main theme in this anime is not just fighting, but also shows what goes on people's minds from both sides of the story. A really amazing psychological anime as well! I WILL MISS CODE GEASS D:\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

However, this movie was kind of a disappointment as I found it hard to remain attentive or just care for the characters or the plot. \r\n \r\nStory: 6/10. \r\nI noticed that I am not really interested in adaptations of legends and myths despite my interest in them, as well as cultures of many different cultures, Japan being one of them. It kind of reminds me of Thumbelina (to an extent, although I am fully aware that the Japanese fairy tale is way older than its counterpart from the 19th century, please don't get me wrong). It's a story about a mysterious girl so beautiful that even princes were dying to ask for her hand in marriage. However, Kaguya's destiny has nothing to do with ordinary human life, even that of a noble. It's slow and overly complicated, which normally works in other Ghibli movies, but this time these unnecessary complications made this incredibly slow movie hard to watch. This movie is too long for such a short story. \r\n \r\nArt: 9/10. \r\nThe art style of this movie reminds me of old Japanese engravings, I am sure this is the image the animators and artists were trying to create and they did a great job as it fits the atmosphere of the story perfectly, I have no complaints about it, so let's give this movie's art a 9 it deserves. \r\n \r\nSound: 8/10. \r\nShame on me, I forgot what the music in this anime was like so I had to look for it once again. And what can I say, Joe Hisaishi knows exactly what he's doing. Not his best work, but he is very talented and I give him credit for that, knowing what he is capable of. \r\n \r\nCharacter: 6/10. \r\nWhen you take an ancient simple tale to work with, characters may be rather simple sometimes. It's not a rule, but it is to be expected. They were okay, but, unfortunately, I found it very hard to genuinely care for any of them. However, showing no interest in any of the characters is even worse than disliking them, at least you do feel something when you dislike or even hate a character. They were fine, but that was it. \r\n \r\nEnjoyment: 6/10. \r\nI have to admit, I was bored. As much as I love and respect Ghibli and their attempt to turn this story into a decent movie, I failed to like it despite having such high hopes at the beginning, when I was just starting to watch it. \r\n \r\nOverall, I believe I should stick to other movies Ghibli has to offer as I enjoy them much more. Maybe this is not my kind of a movie, but this is the second Ghibli film (the first one being Tales from Earthsea, which is not that big of a surprise) I am not going to re-watch. \r\n\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

The real question is, does it deserve this score? Sort of kinda maybe but not really. \r\n \r\nStory 7/10  \r\nThe first season had a great story which I really enjoyed, but Code Geass R2's story got so ridiculous at some points (such as that entire Sword of Akasha episode) that I couldn't help myself from laughing. They decided to throw in tons of random characters that are very very skilled at fighting among other things assuming that no one would question why the fuck they weren't helping Japan against the Black Knights in Season 1. They topped this clusterfuck of a story off with probably the greatest and most satisfying end to an anime in existence, so that's nice. \r\n \r\nArt 8/10  \r\nBesides the triangle faces the art style is pretty basic and smooth \r\n \r\nSound 9/10 \r\nThis show definitely has some good voice actors, that's including the dub Lelouch. His evil laugh gave me some serious chills. \r\n \r\nEnjoyment 9/10  \r\nHere is where the clusterfuck of a story is redeemed, the enjoyment factor of this show is strictly a \"dumb fun\" type enjoyment, where as long as you turn your brain off completely, you should be fine. While \"dumb fun\" enjoyment isn't as fulfilling and memorable as the enjoyment you'll get from storytelling masterpieces like Madoka Magica and Death Note, it's still fun in the end. \r\n \r\nOverall 8/10 \r\n \r\nI feel like they tried too hard to appeal to the masses after the success of season 1, but it's a good 25 episodes nonetheless, and the ending will always be one of my favorites. \r\n \r\n\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

Seems like it is more of another series but with the same characters, rather than a continuation of the previous plot. So far, I was enjoying myself up until the story got to be a bit weird, which was around episode 14 or so. I mean that fact that Tomoya and Nagisa (main characters) are a couple that has been together for I'd say about 2 years and we still have yet to see them kiss, not to mention that fact that they get completely embarrassed about just holding hands?  \r\n \r\nSoon after that, I think the writers of the series kind of wanted to see how far they could take things with the story. It gets very fast-paced, heavy, and somewhat depressing. Honestly I should've stopped watching after episode 14. It gets very sad and depressing after episode 15. But I applaude the writers for taking a chance like this. You don't see too many anime series end in the way that Clannad After Story did. Try it but be prepared for the unexpected (and Fuko (supporting character) doesn't make her ninja appearances)\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

The problem was that they had a ‘puppeteer’ who was changing people’s thoughts and memories in order to use it for his own purpose to hack into official’s heads. I won’t lie, I don’t normally understand all that political stuff. The fact that this was so heavy in that made it more of a chore to try and figure stuff out. If I missed something that someone said, to bad, I couldn’t really go back and check it out because I wouldn’t know where to find it again.  \r\n \r\nWhen we get to the characters, the only ones we really get to understand slightly are Batou and Kusanagi. The others just seem like background characters compared to them. Even then, we don’t get much about the two although you can tell that Batou really cares greatly for Kusanagi. When we do get near the end, it does get into a rather interesting and deep. It really dives into physiological problems and aspects to life. It might of still been a rather confusing show but I did enjoy it. \r\n \r\nThe art style starts out with a lot of CG stuff in the beginning of the show and then going deeper into the normal animation after. I have to say they really took me off guard when they showed the naked body of the major in CG while she was working. Of course then they had to have an opening that expanded on showing a women’s naked body being created through electronic means. There were little scenes where they would do a bit more of the CG and half of it is rather pretty. Some of the characters designs seem a bit off from how they looked in the anime that I had watched part of before, namely the major. Still, the camera angles and some of the ways they showed the world felt very classic to the anime style of the late 1990s.  \r\n \r\nSome of the sounds are a bit off and the English voices sometimes don’t match lip movements but the voice actors really tried their best to make such a serious show work. You can tell just how they read their lines that they were trying really hard to keep it interesting but sadly, I keep feeling that they do a whole lot of talking and sometimes not all that much action or just a lot of shooting. When we do get action, its mostly slow movement, looped or over almost as fast as it starts. Now there are also some talks that feel more like a lecture about the problems with the cyber technology and a philosophy of having your own identity. These small parts were the only things that kept my attention as the others talks seemed a bit more complicated and I had no way of understanding the political problems. \r\n\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

The charm of the series is the story it was full of sadness and heart break, but also some of the funniest moments in an anime i have ever watched. Without getting into too much detail this goes over the effects of season 1 (which you will need to watch to enjoy this anime) and the most amazing anime couple of all time. (although i did skip the episodes 4-8 because i heard they were boring af). The character, story, and enjoyment were far better than a number can describe, this anime left a lasting impact on me and my outlook on life. finally just like this review the ending was really damn confusing. I wish i could erase my memories just so i can go back and watch this anime for the first time again. PS I've been told rewatching it is a total mindfuck because you see everything that caused the ending unfold. \n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

The closest being Spice & Wolf as the two belong to the ‘slice of life’ genre. This is exactly what Clannad is as we follow the life of a High School Senior in Japan who just doesn’t know what he is doing with his life. On the most superficial level Clannad seems little more than a frilly series about finding love and all the stereotypes that are associated with that. To anyone who has watched the series though they will rapidly come to know that this is so far from the truth. What Clannad does so well is bring these characters, their lives, their struggles and their pains to life to the point where I felt like i was going through it with them. One by one we get a peak into the interworkings of peoples lives from the strange to the heartbreaking as everyone tries to be in it together. After all this and the typical High School anime setting the show takes a surprising turn with Clannad: After Story, which is very much dealing with what happens after ‘Happily Ever After’. This is where the struggle of finding yourself in the world and becoming one with society comes to the fore along with the struggle of holding on to what you love and the inevitable compromises that come with growing up. Clannad is a love story, and so is Clannad: After Story, but After Story is very much life as we all know it, with the good times, the bad times and everything that comes in between as we try to go through each and every day. This isn’t a show about heroes or leaders of men, but people. With Clannad i laughed, i teared up and outright sobbed with these characters to the point where i was screaming at my computer that \"It isn’t fair”. Then again life is rarely fair and makes those happy moments all the more precious. Clannad in so many ways just made me feel human like little else ever has. 10/10.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

It’s that one image, frame, or symbol that encapsulates a series so fully and leaves a lasting impression seared into memory. Here, it’s an abyss. And it’s such a perfect, haunting all-pervading imagery of a series that drags you deep into its pitch black vastness that invites mystery, intrigue, and, inevitably, questions. \r\n \r\nWelcome to the Abyss, a gigantic and seemingly endless yawning chasm whose origins and nature remain shrouded in darkness. \r\n \r\nThe great city of Orth is built around a mysterious hole in the ground, one without a hobbit prancing about. It’s a much bigger hole than that, one that houses several mapped layers, all with unique micro-climates and ecosystems. Don’t hold your breath however. Much of the upper layers are bypassed in the haste to the deeper layers. Such a format is utilized to avoid stunting the pacing into a glacial crawl. Strangely enough, it’s that haste that actually causes the series to meander in the middle parts as a setting that offered so many possibilities ended up giving so little. \r\n \r\nThe expectation set when one begins this story is that the focus lies in the abyss itself. The stated goal of the protagonist is to reach her mother at the bottom of the chasm. It is understood that the goal is immaterial. It is merely a catalyst for a journey… for THE journey. \r\n \r\nAnd yet this journey isn’t really about the abyss. That must be corrected before one enters with the wrong expectations. Made in Abyss is about the people exploring the abyss, not the abyss itself. I think that actually makes the title poetic. These people are “Made in Abyss”. This story is about how the Abyss shapes those who brave it. \r\n \r\nAnd that highlights its choice of protagonist: a wide eyed kid who’s just as enthralled by the wonders of her world as we should be, a kid filled with the sense of invulnerability and utter fearlessness that reeks of the sweet summer of youth.  \r\n \r\nThat enhances the kind of story this is more than it takes away. All too often we have protagonists who are jaded by the wonders their world has to offer. To see the brave new worlds through the lens of a kid experiencing them just as we are is a treat that should not be missed. \r\n \r\nAnd, more importantly, we start the journey tabula rasa. \r\n \r\nThe anime did splendid job of circumventing the limitations it imposed on itself by the choice of protagonist. Riko, while chirpy and bright, simply cannot be expected to scale the chasm on her lonesome, or even with her little gaggle of friends. That’s where Reg comes in. Reg is a mysterious bio-mechanical relic of unknown origins saddled with his own limitations that both he and Riko must tango around. Yet even with Reg’s spectacular capabilities, one could still feel a sense of unease. A gut feeling says when push comes to shove, it’s not enough. \r\n \r\nYet they persist. Along the way they are aided by the denizens and veterans of the pit: the jolly Hablog, the indomitable Ouzen, the troubled Nanachi, and the tragic Mitty as their lives are continually shaped by the calls of the great pit. \r\n \r\nSadly however, much of the character progression is not felt. This is still a 14 episode series (that is, 12 normal episodes plus a one-hour special). But it doesn’t need such sweeping character arcs right now. This is the first of hopefully many adventures and it did enough on its own to establish the many characters with respect to the Abyss that captivated them. \r\n \r\nMuch praise must also be lauded to the visuals, and especially the character designs. Such whimsical image serves to highlight the stark contrast with the brutal reality in a journey that strives to go deeper into the heart of the earth and innermost to the core of the yearnings that makes us human…  \r\n \r\n \r\n…Into the abyss, with all of its attendant connotations.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

It was an anime at first glance seem like some typical adventure kids show. However, we are at the end of summer, and I am having a fucken boner. \r\n \r\nThe anime was made by Ninema Citrus, which aired in summer 2017. By manga fans of the series, the adaptation was super hyped by the lot. However for us non manga viewers, it's a different story because of that chibi like art, which repels a bunch of viewers including me. I know a bunch of casuals who considered the anime trash because of it. But when I saw the anime being so high, I decided to watch it and let me just say, I saw why manga readers were hyped for this. It just did so many things right, hence delivering in every aspect to an extremely high standard.  \r\n \r\n(Note: this was a repost of my first review, just tweaked.) \r\n \r\nPlot: 9/10 \r\nThe plot was done extremely well, I can't stress how much I loved it. \r\n \r\nThe execution of the Abyss and it's mysteries were done excellently. I loved how we get just enough information to understand it, however doesn't give too much away. This allowed the Abyss to have possibly one of the best world buildings I saw in recent anime time, which must be credited. The story of Riko and the search for her mum was also executed well. I personally see this story as a way of revealing what the Abyss really is, and hence giving as a practical example of the dangers of it. The stories in between I found to be near perfect. They were engaging and at the same time, allowed the reader as mentioned to see the true dangers of the Abyss. Telling the story in the perspective of Riko was smart, as it allowed the reader to see how as an immature kid will she grow, which I'll get to how well this was done in the characters section. This story is quite complex, which is understandable since this is an anime for analysis. However it never felt too complex to the point of confusion, as the pacing was done exceptionally well. \r\n \r\nThe pacing I found to be perfect. The slow beginning allows the reader when their minds are peaked with thoughts, to be given their first piece of information about the Abyss. After you are given your information, the anime immediately goes faster for you to experience these dangers, which in my books, is pure genius. However, I would had liked the beginning to be slightly shorter because it might had dragged on for far too long. \r\n \r\nI found the anime to stick to its genre. It was an adventure fantasy anime which was consistent throughout the anime. I found the main theme of the anime is being aware of what is real and what is words. The entire point of the anime is to mislead you to think something, however was really something else, which is a fairly great theme to explore. A sub theme is having friends which is a nice touch to this anime. \r\n \r\nNow the ending...ohhhh boy the ending was out of this world. It mixed the right amount of emotions to fully make the reader feel what the characters were feeling. It also built upon the characters that had yet to be built at that point of the anime. To add to the fuel of fire, the arc the series ended was what really made hardcore fans love this series, and I was no exception. I am sure this ending was a setup to get a second season of the anime. \r\n \r\nOverall, the plot was done to a brilliant standard. It had the right amount of execution of plot, pacing, exploration of themes and ending it in style to truly engage the audience into this anime. Despite things being off like the beginning, this anime certainly delivered in a plot aspect. \r\n \r\nCharacter: 9/10 \r\nCharacters were another very strong point of the series, and I'll explain why I believe this view. \r\n \r\nI found the characters to be very relatable. They all had reasonable motives into doing what they did in the series. Take this analogy, your friend is about to turn into Frankenstein or something through an experiment and you don't want them to suffer from this, so what would you do? Break them out, which did happen in some way in Made in Abyss, allowing these characters to be relatable. They were also realistic, especially Riko and Regu. The immaturity of Riko and Regular allows the readers to see them as themselves as a child, like I totally understand why she did what she did in the series, which is very good and should be appreciated.  \r\n \r\nDevelopment of characters was spot on. Riko definitely saw some development into a more mature character towards the end of the series, and certainly felt as though in the next arc, she won't commit the same mistakes she did in the first season. Her development was reasonably normal, as we can see how once she makes a mistake, it didn't happen again. Regu also developed as a person, gaining new skills as he journeyed with a Riko. Let me just say, these two as a partner has very good chemistry. They weren't the only characters fleshed out. Others such as Nanachi and Ozen also had their fair share of fleshing out. Without going into too much spoilers, I'll just say that Nanachi was what really made the series alive, which watching it will allow you to see why. \r\n \r\nExcept the end, the antagonist wasn't really revealed, and I would had liked to see it more. The side characters were certainly an interesting bunch to me. They had the right amount of screen time to be seen, which made us not forget them for too long during their respective arcs. \r\n \r\nNanachiIsMyWaifuAndAllOfYouStayAwayFromHer-literally what it says \r\n \r\nTherefore, the character section of the anime is brilliant. The development and realism really sets the bar high for any other animes that can be closely compared to Made In Abyss, however I would had like to see the side characters just a little more than in the series. \r\n \r\nAnimation: 10/10 \r\nI actually found the animation to be the strongest point to the series for various reasons. \r\n \r\nTo begin with, the designs of these characters were gorgeous, like holy sweet rabbit. The moment I saw some of these characters I immediately fell in love with them. I feel like the chibi designs were deliberate to truly show the immaturity of the main characters, and how they don't see the danger ahead of them. \r\n \r\nAnimating the series was done well too. I did not see any sort of laziness and wasn't jarring to watch. The art style for this anime was very unique, like pretty much one of their kind, which is an art style I totally want to see again. \r\n \r\nThe backgrounds were also out of this world. It gave an atmospheric view of the Abyss, and how there is something off with this world. I can't really complain too much about it. \r\n \r\nOverall, amazing designs. Animation, background and just the fact of the uniqueness of the anime truly allowed it to flourish in the animation department \r\n \r\nSound: 9/10 \r\nI found the song choices and voice actors to be chosen well, to the point where I had minimal complaints. \r\n \r\nThe op is quite catchy, and gets you hyped up for the series.  The ending was also a nice close to the episode to me. Getting the voice actors to me was quite smart, as it further adds into the misleading nature of the anime. \r\n \r\nThe voice actors played their part fairly well. No one really kept out of character, and they didn't sound too annoying at one point of the series \r\n \r\nConcluding this part, the sound was done well, however wasn't exactly an excelling point to the series. \r\n \r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \r\nEvery ep reinforces even further why this anime is brilliant. The anime manages to engage the reader through it's unpredictable nature, which by the anime goes on, the less predictable becomes. At one point my predictions were the complete opposite of what actually occurred, which was kinda sad in my part.  \r\n \r\nAnother strong factor which engages the reader is the characters, especially Ozen and Nanachi. These two characters are what really brought the series fully alive, and were very entertaining to watch for anyone.  \r\n \r\nNothing else much to say other then how incredibly engaging the anime was. \r\n \r\nOverall: 9.25/10 \r\nOverall, this was definitely the dark horse and best anime of the season. People should never ever get misleaded by art, otherwise they'll miss gem animes like Made in Abyss. This anime offers so much to get the audience thinking, which they handled it perfectly by giving us the right amount of information to build on their fragile minds. The character development is near perfect, the music was good and the animation had very strong symbolism, it was just an anime full of mystery, engagement and sometimes even fun. I sure hope they will be a season 2 and will be equally as engaging as the first. \r\n \r\nI'd definitely recommend this masterpiece to any non casual viewers. Casuals will find this boring because of the lack of action scene and \"questionable\" art, but for non casuals, this is a very veteran anime you should get into. This is because of how you have to see between the lines to fully reveal the true nature of this anime, hence why I consider this to be for those who had a watched a handful of different genres of anime. \r\n \r\n#Hypeforseason2\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

What I was most impressed by was the despite the complexity and genre of this story the writing kept it's integrity. Once you complete the show you realize that the writer knew what they were doing all along (which you would think is obvious but so many unfortunately do not do this) The characters and world building are fascinating and so much fun. The ideas of alchemy and biblical references and moral complications are utilized to a great affect. The dialogue is funny and natural, but the show can get really serious too. A good balance and well paced. (At times it can drag a little but it's rare) You even learn a lot watching it. The art style isn't my cup of tea but it's tight and the production was given money so there's never a lag of quality really. This is definitely a good, palatable classic. I'd especially recommend this if you're just getting into anime. \n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

It mostly focuses on this overpowered bald man who seeks the thrill and enjoyment of battles that he had lost due to his immense power. Not to say it's a bad thing, but it did leave me questioning 'Is there more to it?'. While the plot did progress halfway through, I think the idea of only revolving around battles diminishes the interesting aspects of the world of heroes, monsters and aliens. A lot of potential is out there and I believe that we'll get to see more of the other non-battle things. A stronger aspect that One Punch Man delivers is in the characters, especially the master-disciple relationship. Many of the other characters have their own cool power and personality so there's that boost of enjoyment. Seeing more of them is something I'll be looking for. \r\n \r\nSo, what about the battles? I can definitely say that Madhouse has the skills to make the word epic pop out. No arguments could be made about how eye catching, fluid and powerful the animations were. It was outstanding. The lighting and shakes made the scenes intense with all the explosions and power produced by the characters. All the more so, the sound effects amplified this even further. For the voice acting and OSTs, it was kind of average with the exceptions of a couple soundtracks. They did capture the personality of the characters, especially the main character. \r\n \r\nOne Punch Man begins as a story that fleshes out the world. We see all this powerful heroes and villains, but the story didn't really delve more into them except for the battles. I have hopes that their origins and goals will be introduced bit by bit in future seasons. In the meantime, this anime succeeds as being highly action-packed.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

THERE IS LITERALLY NO EPISODE WHERE IT'S SERIOUS. The shortness of the fighting scenes never get old. Yusuke Murata did a good job at making stories. \r\n \r\nSo to conclude my review, i give one punch man an  ∞/10.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

Like most shows that garner this level of hype, there are three distinct camps, two of which being the most prominent of them: those who praise the show as some messiah of anime, to an extent that sounds like their father had just come back from the dead or something, edgy hipsters that nitpick and bash the show just because it's popular, and the type that you find plenty of on MAL, but none in real life, the ones who say \"oh it's good, but not that good xd.\" I happen to fall in the third, so here goes: \r\n \r\nSYNOPSIS \r\n \r\n- I will not address this too much, as everyone knows the concept: Bald guy seeks out opponents that he is truly matched by, because he beats them all in one punch, he gets his sidekick Genos, and a bunch of people come into play. I've had an interest in the series since it was shown in the 2015 anime lineup, given the premise and none other than Madhouse itself. I wish I had watched it weekly, rather than binging it after the show's popularity blew up. The idea, and genre labels itself should tell you how much you're going to like the show. It's no more than a parody of the shounen genre that shouldn't be taken so seriously, which is unfortunately buried in that sea of 10/10 ratings, and the #13 spot on MAL. Do not set your expectations of this show to be a masterpiece, or you will be massively disappointed. Set it as what you think the genre, and production credits entail. Half of the show relies on the joke itself, which is repetitive, and isn't one that most should be laughing at consistently.  \r\n \r\nSTORY 7/10 \r\n \r\n- The story itself is quite simple, a proper introduction to our hero Saitama, and how he and Genos travel through short arcs with threats escalating in danger, and having more heroes, villains, and the ironic Hero Association slowly being unraveled over time. It's a formulaic cycle that relies on the distinctiveness of each arc's monsters/dilemmas, heroes, and set-pieces, which either hit or miss. There are genuinely funny moments, like the whole encounter with Sonic, some entertaining fights like the S-class heroes against the endlessly regenerating goons of Boros, but there are some failures like the moment where Mumen Rider is putting his life on the line against the Sea King in episode 8, only to have nearly immediate intervention from Saitama and Genos, as expected. I also feel like I was the only one disappointed by the fight with Boros. Yes, it was gloriously animated, had a well-placed use of the theme song, and the heralded \"OK\" face. It was memorable, but not for all the right reasons. The fact that he was letting himself get hit so much, wasn't to gauge his strength, but to prolong the fight. As Saitama did nothing but get back to Earth from the moon, Boros was saying \"oh, I should go all out,\" like what the hell? I know I will get shit for this, but I enjoyed the dream sequence battle from the first episode, and the sparring match with Genos and Saitama more, as they have more rewatchability, and are a little more clever than, \"let Saitama wait it out and make the guy give it all before the punch\" (the punch was amazing, I'll give it that.) The ending itself too just leaves itself on an unsatisfying note, and is in desperate need for a season two, but at least it sticks true to the manga events. Overall, the show does it's best to distract from the fact that you know Saitama will save the day, with some comedy, and glorious action scenes to do so. The short arcs are more about the journey than the destination, but sometimes the journey just simply doesn't work.  \r\n \r\nCHARACTERS- 8/10 \r\n \r\n- If all the Saitama profile pictures on the internet tell you one thing, it's that the show delivered on it's characters. This is the aspect that the show handles best in my opinion, as it expands onto stereotypes with clever placement, and outstanding character design which I will get to in a minute, but first, our caped baldy, the protagonist himself \r\n \r\nSaitama- Compared to the rest of the show, he is the most unique, and is one of the selling points of the show. The plain, sometimes emotionless hero, who only fights for fun. He works brilliantly, as a hilarious converse of the shounen protagonist, fighting for himself, not \"muh friendship,\" being overpowered instead of struggling for the sake of \"muh friendship,\" and just being quirky, but not a deconstruction. Rocking the Mr.Clean look, his yellow suit with the red gloves is as plain and distinctive as it gets. His expressionless face works, but sometimes it's not necessary. I'd honestly rather see the face on the cover of Road To Hero more often, that shit is badass, especially would work in the fight against Boros (sorry for slamming that fight, it's plain overrated.) His character doesn't develop, no one would expect that, but much of his memorability is owed to his sidekick, Genos \r\n \r\nGenos- The fangirl bait cyborg sidekick, the one robot who wants to know more about himself, and be as good as Saitama, by going under his wing. He himself isn't too interesting, but the chemistry he has with Saitama is executed quite well. Genos is the almost typical caricature of the striving anime guy with good looks, and this personality goes hand in hand with the carefree attitude of Saitama, the one he wants to learn from. The lack of romantic subplots leave a lot up to this duo's chemistry, and in that regard, the show gets it quite well. (100 push ups, 100 sit ups, 1 km run everyday!)  \r\n \r\nThe rest aren't exactly anything to write home about, the show focuses on them two, and the rest are relegated to side roles to propel specific episodes along. The thing is, they all embody some humorous spin on a well-known archetype, and what ONE does with these, makes for some really fun watching. Whether it be the endless wisdom of the Heihachi look-a-like, Bang, the endless justice pouring from the weak but courageous Mumen Rider, the characters will stick with you for how well defined they are. When you discuss the show with anyone, you will remember \"green haired brat,\" \"blue haired douche,\" \"gay prison dude,\" \"emo Sonic, with that inferiority complex tho.\" In conclusion, the most well done part of the show, it doesn't need, but doesn't have any complexity warranting such a rating. \r\n \r\nART 8/10 \r\n \r\n- Look, it's Madhouse, it's quality. It's not their best, but it sure as hell works. It's not flawless, there are a few quips, like when Saitama fought that one monster underground in the white room, but overall, it shines when it needs to, such as the fight with Boros. Every character is well-done, in the style of the remastered art of the ongoing manga. \r\n \r\nSOUND 7/10 \r\n- ONE PUUUNNNNCCCHHH!!!! *guitar riff kicks in* yea that's all there is to the soundtrack. Everything besides the opening is well-produced, and fits in, but nothing sticks after the two months since watching it. \r\n \r\nENJOYMENT 9/10 \r\n-It's not a perfect show, but it's a damn fun ride worth taking. I wasn't laughing as much as I thought I would, and I was sure let down by the hype, as anyone would be. It was still worthwhile and recommendable, and to  it's credit, it reinvigorated my love for anime.  \r\n \r\nFINAL SCORE- 7.5/10, go watch that shit. Just see it for hype's sake, there's something good you'll take from it.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

It's all got to do with the way they handle the atmosphere. The pacing is fantastic, which is amazing considering the story line spans the better part of seven years in twenty-two episodes. \r\nThe series in general is a metaphor for growing up. In the first season the drama is often accompanied by humorously childish moments. It was a simpler and, for lack of a better word, happier time. In Clannad: After Story, the humorous moments mostly serve as means of nostalgia, for the characters to look back at the simpler days. But it's made very clear that those days are long gone. Nothing gold can stay, and it's time to look to the future. It's mature, it's realistic\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

Seriously, what the actual fuck. THIS is the \"masterpiece\" that I \"had\" to watch? I pushed myself through the boringness of the prequel in order to experience the supposedly \"amazing pleasure\" that is Clannad: After Story, and THIS is what I get? \r\n \r\nLook, I'll be fair. Clannad: After Story is not a bad anime. It's definitely better that its bad prequel. However, that's really not saying much, is it? While After Story manages to give us a more interesting story than its prequel, it falls victim to plenty of the same problems and adds some new ones as well. \r\n \r\nStory: After Story starts out exactly where the prequel left off: boring high school crap. After we have to sit through even more boring arbitrary sadness involving all the female characters that didn't get used up in the prequel, the anime finally graduates and enters the rest of the world. The story really picks up there, and we get to watch a few genuinely interesting episodes. Most of the cast is put on a bus so we can focus on the characters that actually matter without annoyances, and the events that unfold draw your attention. Unfortunately, there's a climax soon afterwards, and everything goes to shit again. The anime returns to shoving arbitrary sadness down our throats. I pushed myself through the boredom hoping for a satisfying conclusion, but I was disappointed, as the ending throws all logic and coherence in the trash can in order to force something impossible to happen. After the story ends there are two additional side-story episodes, which I didn't watch and therefore can't tell you about. I'm assuming they are bad.  \r\n \r\nArt: After Story looks good, just like the prequel. The problem of female characters (or feminine boy characters) having way too large eyes remains, but other than that, no complains. The settings look good, the male characters look good, the animation is good. \r\n \r\nSound: The voice acting is good just like that of the prequel, maybe a bit better. The music is basically the same, but it feels more intrusive this time. It's not bad on its own, but the way it is used can be really annoying at times. \r\n \r\nCharacters: The main character is definitely more interesting than last time. It's also nice how most of the cast was written out of the biggest part of the show, since we got rid of subpar characters that way. But in general, there's not really anything else to praise here. It's not like most of the characters that remain are actually interesting. Not to mention that some of the new characters did not pull their weight, either. \r\n \r\nIf you liked the first Clannad, watch this. You'll definitely like it. If you didn't like the first Clannad but are thinking of watching After Story because you've heard about how it's significantly better and a masterpiece and all those things, don't. It's just a waste of your time, unless you plan on using the knowledge to argue with Clannad fans. \r\n \r\n\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

I haven't cried over a piece of fiction in a very long time. Hell, the only thing I can remember that actually made me cry was the Gary Come Home thing from Spongebob, and that was when I was, what, 5 years old? Now, 12 years later, I am straight up sobbing over this show. I didn't think it could do it to me, but this show broke a streak of no tears over TV over a decade long. I've never laughed so much with tears in my eyes \r\n \r\nTo be fair, when I originally started Clannad... I HATED it. I was only watching it because the guy who recommended it wouldn't let me drop it. So, I watched it... a couple of good episodes here and there but really nothing special. The end of the first season was alright but then episodes 5-9 of After Story were so bad I almost dropped it again. But I kept going, and I ended up binging episodes 10-19 in one afternoon, then the rest of it just now. \r\n \r\nThis show really suffers from it's first episodes, completely unrelated and superficial nothingness. I'd say to skip them but the small amount of character development is worth it. I'm also not a huge fan of the art style, but you do get used to it and it actually kinda grew on me by the end. I'd been a fan of more realistic art styles like those used in Naruto or Beck (Clearly still anime but not over-done) but now I can say I've broadened my horizons.  \r\n \r\nThis show has the type of music that ends up sticking with you. The music you'll play in your head on a sad day that you won't be able to shake. Don't get me wrong, this show has RUINED MY ENTIRE LIFE... but in a good way. I love and hate this show. This show should be shown as torture for what it does to you emotionally. It is heart-crushing and soul lifting. It is just...amazing.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

It focuses on Nodame and Chiaki going to Vienna to visit the concert-mistress from Rising Star - Kiyora Miki- who is also getting ready for a competition in Paris. In the second half of the episode they are back in Paris and Mine [her BF from season 1] comes to see her perform without telling her. She performs and makes it to the final round -- I won't say what happens after that.  \r\n \r\nBut it's a really funny episode and it definitely adds to the story. I'd recommend watching it before starting the Fianle [season 3]. \n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

It seemed like one of those high-school dramas. It was, but not in the way you would think. CLANNAD After Story is filled with both humor and despair, something that's hard to fuse in an animé. However, in CLANNAD they succeeded with a perfect contrast. It may seem boring from the start and maybe you'll think about it like a direct continuation of CLANNAD, but After Story is actually a lot different and it definitely has a deeper meaning.  \r\nOne tip, watch it. \r\n\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

I came into the second season really expecting to find the exact same thing. \r\n \r\nThe first maybe 10 episodes or so are also like the first season. boring. However. after that is when things really start to get good. If you have dropped this series and only watched the first season, or the first 10 episodes of the second season, I would HIGHLY recommend you to continue watching this until the very end. \r\n \r\n-SPOILERS AHEAD- \r\n \r\nI cry when watching just about ANY anime but I cried about 5x as much during this anime. When Nagisa died I really did get depressed about the whole thing and wanted to drop it but I ended up watching the rest and really did enjoy it. When Ushio died on the other hand, I really didn't know what to think as I didn't think anything good was really gonna come of the rest of the series. I didn't understand what happened in episode 22 for a LONG time but I really did enjoy the fact that this series got to have a happy ending. To this day I'm not really sure if that ending was implemented to prevent thousands people from committing suicide, or if they really wanted a weird ending as that. Also, the hidden world stuff seemed very sketchy throughout the whole series.  \r\n \r\nOverall, I give this anime a 9/10 because of the well-rounded characters and plot. I also very appreciated the happy ending because I was thinking of never watching anime ever again.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

Will we be all happy-go-lucky and not think of disappointing things? Maybe; Well, I′m a sucker when it comes to Dramas. No, really. I hate it. It′s not that I hate Dramas, what I hate is me being a crybaby and a sucker when watching Drama-Romance Anime. Especially when there′s tragedy involved. OH HELL NO. I can′t stand it, it′s like I want to bawl my eyes out all day; But nevertheless, Dramas are one of the most popular genres, which, I like a lot, next to slapstick comedy, that is. Drama has it's own excellent attributes, and one of it is to make us shed manly tears. \r\n \r\nAfter Story made a huge impact on me, I was greatly dumbfounded by it's perfectness. It changed a lot of things for me; on how I view Drama-Romance anime, how a certain death can lead your life to going down. It′s hard to not shed a tear while After Story is playing right before your very eyes. \r\n \r\nAfterstory is all about, Love, Family, Grief, Happiness, Sorrow and Relationship. \r\nAnd how they prove that not all stories have a happy ending and that not everything are meant to happen the way they desire. All of this will be told by a certain person′s point of view, or how he views these “ends” and “endings” from his current standing and his current life. \r\n \r\nAfter Story is the continuation of the not-so-sad CLANNAD. We′re still in Tomoya′s perspective and point of view of the story, which is, perfect for viewing a certain person's life and beliefs. Although here in After Story, a lot of aspects and points from the prequel had changed. But that's what made the story and plot even more outstanding. \r\n \r\nThe latter continues from where CLANNAD left off -- the path where Okazaki Tomoya is walking at -- Tomoya confessed and asked Nagisa out. Isn′t that a happy thing? Yes, it IS. After watching this scene, you′ll start to think that, things are going pretty well. And sure that it′ll have a happy ending; All of us want to have a happy ending in our lives, all of us want to experience love--to love someone and to be loved. Loving someone isn′t just a simple game that you play. You′ll experience lots of hardships, you′ll need to overcome obstacles if you want to be happy; And that′s what Nagisa and Tomoya were experiencing during the time that both of them fell in love with each other. \r\n \r\nFinally, after decades of waiting, ROMANCE barges in! I know we′ve all been waiting for this. And it really was worth the wait. After Story, being a Romance Anime isn′t all about love or full of 'cheesy' moments. Do not forget the Slice of Life here. The genres in After Story were distributed and divided really great. I like how when there′s romance, there′ll be an insert of drama or comedy from time to time. \r\n \r\nI really like how all the genres were mixed in After Story, but the genre who′s in majority is the DRAMA. After Story is an absolute tear-jerker; understanding the story from Tomoya′s perspective and point of view is one of the most saddest things to witness. \r\n \r\nThe characters involved in the story had great roles which left a great memory and impact on me. I really like the mix of characters in the story: A Tsundere? I approve. A loli. A kuudere. A normal guy. A pervert. A dandere. They had great roles! All of them were part of Tomoya′s journey. \r\n \r\nI wouldn′t really call this as 'Enjoyment', rather, for me, this story isn′t enjoyable at all - in a comedic way. Albeit, After Story is much that of a super tear-jerker story. But we′ll use the term 'enjoyed' here on: I really enjoyed watching and witnessing the story of the people involved in After Story. All of the relationships were greatly pushed down to leave a mark. \r\n \r\nAfter Story had taught us lots of things: Having your own family is on of the best things in the world. It taught us that even the death of one person can break you down. It′s not all about SMILES and LAUGHS. From time to time, you need to let it all out. \r\n \r\nAll I can is, people who were dearest to you that are now gone, must not let you down. You need to stand tall and be strong, no matter how much grief you′re feeling. Surely, it was a huge loss to you - but look on the bright side, there′s an 'alternate ending' waiting for you. \r\n \r\nWho knows. It might just be a nightmare and you′ll soon wake up from it. Think of all the good things. Don't think that nothing would change; every little thing and person in the world undergoes changes. And you′ll experience something far from what you expected. \r\n \r\nSo just sit back and let the one-of-the-most-outstanding story take you away from your little world.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

I was intrigued by how the story had flowed and by how brilliantly its creator had managed to capture the energy that comes with life in this series.  I was amazed even further as the story continued beyond your typical slice-of-life anime to show the lives of the characters as they continued along their chosen paths. \r\n \r\nClannad ~After Story~ is more serious than Clannad was.  It does not, however, step right into a serious atmosphere, but instead flows the storyline naturally into the serious atmosphere as our own lives do.  It retains the happy moments that make you burst out laughing so hard you almost cry, but not at the cost of the story or the serious moments.  It continues to deliver on the atmospheres that the anime creates, no matter how sad, happy, or weird they may be. \r\n \r\nUnlike the typical slice-of-life anime, Clannad ~After Story~ dares to be different.  Instead of focusing a little on the pain that life brings and the joys that there are to replace them; it focuses on the reality of life as it is and the mindsets that are sometimes born from the joy or harshness of reality.  Despite doing so, it's not worth turning one's back on this anime simply because it focuses on reality as it is, instead of how we wish it to be.  That is not to say though that this anime focuses entirely on the negative.  Quite the contrary.  Instead, it gets you thinking on how we truly perceive the world around us.  If you are negative, then yes, you will see only the negative in this anime.  Positive, you'll see the joy that's hidden here. \r\n \r\nThis anime is a must watch.  It has the rare ability to worm its way into the hearts of its viewers.  Deeper in fact if they've seen Clannad beforehand.  Equally, it dares to delve deeper than most anime wish to risk and does so in a way that does not leave the watcher hating the anime for it.  10/10.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

You immediately notice a change of style. If the first part (Hades Sanctuary) had dared, with some changes to the story and a bit of CG in the graphics, here we essentially stick to the manga faithfully, without even great animations. \r\n \r\nHistory manages to remain good, in the Underworld with Dante inspiration. The main problem is that that feeling of war is missing, the characters are scattered, and of serious battles, in true Saint Seiya style, there are very few.  \r\n \r\nA fairly painful key is the characterization of the enemies. Except for Rhadamanthys, already presented in the previous part, most of the specters lack charisma, they save just a couple. \r\n \r\nOf course, there are some good parentheses (like that of Orpheus), some unexpected twists, some badass moments for a couple of characters, and an epic closure, but in general you feel that something is missing in this part. \r\n\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

Lupin's gang will steal from those who can take the loss and are either a criminal or some corrupt influential figure in society and will only resort to killing as a last resort or against criminals worst than they are. Fujiko making use of her body to get what she wants and Lupin's perversion are back, though these elements are somewhat toned down. Zenigata appeared to get the biggest shafting in this series as his character borders on incompetent and clueless in many episodes here, compared to when he was a more competent detective in other titles of the franchise who only fails to capture Lupin because of the thief being one step ahead of him when making an escape. \r\n \r\nLike the first series, many episodes in this second Lupin III series are non-linear and self-contained in their developments with each episode focused either on one of Lupin's heists, devoting focus to an element of one of his gang members/ Zenigata or dealing with a criminal threat within that episode. The writing in these episodes tend to vary ranging from subpar to very good as episodes that were grounded on a criminal element or Lupin's thievery were the highlight for me while any episode focused on some sci-fi or supernatural element got too out there for me with the show's comedy (most infamous case being an episode where Lupin and pals encounter a couple of giant ogres who make them into living shogi pieces). While the series is good at creating fresh episode plots to keep things from getting repetitive, the lack of any ongoing plot developments compared to modern incarnations of the Lupin III franchise may turn away some fans, especially with its lengthy 155 episode length. \r\n \r\nAs to be expected of a series this old, the animation style is quite outdated with drab colors, simple details with scenery and character designs, and noticeable animation shortcuts and errors. However, a few later episodes directed by Hayao Miyazaki offer the anime's best visual presentation as their quality is more smoother with lining and there is noticeably more fluid animation compared to most other episodes within this series. Music had a mix of upbeat, energetic and tense tracks to compliment funny and serious moments within the show, including the signature Theme from Lupin III track used in two different versions for the anime's OP sequence. \r\n \r\nOverall, this second Lupin TV anime has the typical humor of the show that will make it a joy for fans of the classic anime character, though be warned the show's 150+ episode length and non-linearity may keep you from watching the series for its entire run. \n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

Lupin the 3rd is one of those works. \r\n \r\nStarting the grandson of the first Lupin, Lupin the 3rd. Known all around the world for his thieving skills, charismatic personality, and monkey face. \r\nHis gang of The marksman Gigen, the samurai Goemon, and the charming cat-thief Fujiko all link together for what to be a humorous set of adventures. \r\nThe plot mostly consist of single-case episodes. Familiar faces pops-up every once a while, like Detective Zenigata, whose sole purpose in life is see Lupin behind bars. \r\nThe series will take you into a world-tour journey as the great Lupin's adventures know no bounds! \r\nso you won't get bored of the same stages every episode. \r\nbut you might get bored of its the simple nature, as the show itself is considered primitive, and you will find yourself laughing sometimes on things that were not made for that! (lazy drawings, goofy sounds) \r\nThe staff behind the show like the animators and producers didn't really make a good impression, but you will love the classic voice actors who've done a great job with their characters. \r\nSo basically, if you didn't like the characters, then you better off not wasting your time on 100+ eps anime with no serious plot. \r\nbut if you do , then you will have your fare share of fun adventures and comical situations. \r\nI can finally describe this series as being very simple, yet very fun! \r\nThe red-jacket Lupin is the best amongst the 3 Lupin TV series! and it made it possible for all the movies the came after it, much to the joy of the fans! \r\n \r\nThis franchise has carved its mark on anime history, and it's on of those fine classics that any anime fan might want to check out\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

Meaning, more comedy, less violence relating to murder, and more heists focused on \"operation-based\" stealing. The art and sound has significantly improved to the prequel, which has held up today. Our man Miyazaki played a role in a number of episodes relating to directing, art, and background art. \r\n \r\nNaturally being an episodic anime, some episodes are better than others. It isn't until episode 50 where two-part episodes come in, and the series gets a boost in entertainment. \r\n \r\nThis is a good anime running 155 episodes to gradually watch over time. Nothing wrong, but I still prefer the more mature style that Part I had.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

And it really began good. Great episodes like their stay in Rio or the adventure with Nessie in Loch Ness, Scotland, are what I now simply call \"classic\".  \r\nThe problem with this series, though, is, that the episodes don't relate to each other. Ok, just watching one parter again and again can be fun, if you have to watch 155 episodes, though,  it can be really annyoing (I'm a Lupin fan ever since I watched some of the 90's films, so dropping was no option for me). This was also the reason I put this series on hold after about 40 episodes. \r\n \r\nWell, I continued watching it of course, moreover, I stumbled across  some nice to great episodes. One of them I'd like to highlight is Jigen's escape from Russia with a prima balerina. Amazing! \r\nHowever, after about 80 episodes the subtitles became horribly to read, why? Subtitles layed over other subtitles, really no fun. This continued until episode 130. \r\n \r\nAs for the art and sound - don't expect anything too great. This anime aired from '77 to '80, besides, the music is mostly annyoing (especially the \"Super Hero\" song) \r\n \r\nIn terms of characters...yaaay! Jigen Daisuke has become one of my most favourite ones while watching this series. Cool and calm, always ready to help Lupin, the womanizer out of his pinches. Lupin himself can be a pain in the ass, when he's trying to hit on women (and always fails xD). Goemon, who is cool, too and Fujiko complete the gang.  \r\nAlways persuing them is the (sometimes) lunatic Inspector Zenigata, a man who devoted his life apprehending Lupin bringing about more damage than he stops lol. \r\n \r\nAll in all, if you watched the first series and you enjoyed it, this is a must watch, although there are so many horrible episodes. As a fan of the films I just had to watch this. And although I only give this a 6/10, I really don't feel as if I wasted my time watching it. The last episodes, by the way, where so good, that I'm looking forward to watching the third and last of the series.  \r\n \r\nThanks for reading x> !!! \r\n\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

Also i love the way where the musician was able to manipulate the traditional music to suit particular moods such as \"humor\" and \"nostalgia\" The voicing was good, especially Yaichi's.  \r\n \r\nCharacter(8) - The characters were interesting, especially the main protagonist and some members he associates, the situation where all the characters merge together is impressive. You can pry into different personalities and learn something.  \r\n \r\nEnjoyment(7) - I enjoyed it in a calm fashion, everything is calm in that anime, there are no unnecessary fights, no commotions, it fairly gets to the point. There are some surprises here and there which captivates the audience. Humor-wise it's actually lacking, but there were some moments.   \r\n \r\nOverall(7) - I wouldn't really recommend to anyone who needs a Samurai-like atmosphere as there is no excitement of combats, but it truly gives you a medieval atmosphere merged with elements of sadness,philosophy and calmness. \n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

It follows a very bland main character into a world with the most unconventional people. It's historic setting (Edo Period) being very commonly used was not overly exciting to see again, but it was well done none the less. I found it enjoyable because of how each character had depth and  a back-story (even if not revealed totally or at first). The action part was low in quantity, but the surprise moments of violence were excellent and exciting enough for me to continue watching. = )\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

And the theme tunes were awful which is a shame as some of the music in the actual episodes was great. Thankfully, no annoying chibi characters, although the cat came close at times.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

This is my favorite anime.  If you enjoyed Kaiba, Cowboy Bebop, or Usagi Drop, check this out. \r\n \r\nThat said, I am a fan of character-driven stories and storytelling consisting of more show than tell.  Above all, Saraiya Goyou is in my book a masterpiece because of the adept, layered plot and well-paced story.  I must warn you, since I love this show so much, this review will be long and detailed.   \r\n \r\nStarting with story (10/10), a social outcast, but skilled sworsdsman for hire, Akitsu,  \r\n is introduced.  Many anime titles (generic ones typically) would attempt to redeem the character, with the character we love proving him/her to the world.  This marks Saraiya Goyou as smart, breaking conventions. The story unravels the psyche of the main character and others over time.  As it is a Slice of Life, it also attempts to offer a glimpse of the real, sometimes harsh samurai world.  Yet it does so in a slow and relaxing manner, forcing you to feel sentimental, perhaps even pensive.  Story is a major asset of Saaiya Goyou, as every aspect of it (music, characters, art, etc.) are interwoven  through the world, without inconsistency.  World building is the strongest aspect of this series.  The tremendous depth of characters as we see their emotions painted across their faces, lets us dig deeper into a time, setting, and ultimately an individual.   \r\n \r\nThe art (10/10) of Saraiya Gayou is strong, if it does not rub you the wrong way.  Many would most likely be turned off if only fans of moe, shonen, etc.  This title is much more serious, therefore art follows suit.  The art is difficult for some people  because, although original, it is stylized.  Really, it fits well with all other aspects of the show, as it is both unconventional, and easily conveys expressions and gestures of characters, and helps establish the setting (a difficult feat for art to accomplish).  For example, the color palette is dreary, adding to the melancholic mood.  \r\n Animation is similar to what would be expected in a late 90's-mid 00's  anime, but everyone knows that is the best time for anime anyway.   \r\n \r\nAdmittedly, sound (10/10) is not something I spend much attention to, unless a score is otherworldly.  The score is similar to Mushishi's, quiet yet memorable, minimal and appropriate.  \r\n \r\nThe characters (10/10) are basically the plot, in that they are integral to the story; yes, all of them.  I will say that each character has their quirks and background.  We learn about them over time.  We depend upon information about the characters for the story to continue.  Since we spoke about plot no need to write further. \r\n \r\nEnjoyment (10/10).  Why 10/10?  It's my favorite anime of course.  Out of the anime I've watched there has been no other title, that offers as much of a complex or stylistic world.  It makes you happy you are smart, because Saraiya Goyou is extremely sophisticated.  Truly, this show treats us as if we were observers (flies on the wall), of an ethereally suspended place.  It unwraps to reveal a complex puzzle, candidly presented, with pieces faded and hinted scent of sweet, sickly passion.  Words like this better describe the show than using reasoning or logic. \n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

I will get to the point immidiately. \r\n \r\nStory : 10 \r\nHere is a story about a samurai with no self-confidence, who is gradually convinced to join a gang. There is barely any bloodshed, only the everyday lives of the members as they plan their new crimes. In terms of originallity, this anime is the top of the top of the samurai/historical genre. \r\n \r\nThe purpose of this anime is not only to display the violence or the traditions of the time that it takes place. It is destined to recount the circumstances of each character and justify their way of life and their choices, which adds mystery and suspense to the story as well. \r\n \r\nArt : 10 \r\nWhat can I say about it? I was completely taken by its landscapes, the details of nature-themed scenes as long as the town's buildings - I have never seen so detailed premises in an anime ever before. You may think that it doesn't make a difference, but it is really an eye-candy. \r\n \r\nCharacters are designed in a very special and unconventional way, too. I found their eyes and hair very interesting, and as with the buildings, it was something I've never seen before. \r\n \r\nSound : 8 \r\nI really liked the themes played subtly throught the episodes. What I found rather odd and not fitting were the opening and ending themes. I think they tried to combine an old era theme with modern music (like Samurai Champloo), but didn't manage to make decent pieces. It was a pity, but didn't affect the overall enjoyment whatsoever. \r\n \r\nCharacter : 10 \r\nThe creator of the anime just nailed it. Absolutely likeable and utterly interesting characters. If I ever got into the thug life I would choose these homies. Really. \r\n \r\nThe main character is a shy ronin, whose lack of self esteem is always mistaken for unreliability and troubles his career. He is struggling to find a master who will keep him as a bodyguard for more than a few days. But, as the story advances, you find out what a heart of pure gold he posesses. He's the kind of guy each of us would like to have as a best friend - you could always rely on him during harships or when you simply wanted someone who would listen to you and encourage you. A guy pretty naive that everyone would tease but love to have around. \r\n \r\nHe eventually explores the personalities, motives and interesting backrounds of the rest of the gang members, as he is very curious of the people who is involved with and likes to consider them as family. Their characters are not black or white, they may be thieves but each of them could give you the most outstanding lessons about honesty anyone could ever give you. \r\n \r\nEnjoyment : 10 \r\nΙ was fascinated. I watched each episode with irreducible interest. I recommend it to everyone.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

The pacing is done just right. Other reviews mention this: this isn't heavy on action. Instead the feel is more of an slice-of-life adventure. Love it. \r\n \r\nArt 10/10: \r\n \r\nIf your not used to seeing different styles of animation then it may be a little odd, but give it some time and you'll come to accept and hopefully enjoy it. Its *well executed, consistent, and fairly creative (the colors used are less so, but match well and I guess that's what matters more). Really enjoyed seeing a unique animation style that didn't feel \"experimental\" (not that there's anything wrong with that, but for some reasons they then can't seem to shy away from somewhat confusing mind games and narrative funkyness - this kinda show won't work with either). Love it. \r\n \r\nSound 10/10: \r\n \r\nNever feels super high budget but always, always on point. You can tell from the very first episode that the sound was meticulous and designed very well. The music - and this I feel is a little rare even for shows that do sound well - is *very well hidden* but still carries a lot of tone/style/etc in every scene. I need to emphasize *very well hidden, its almost hard to notice - unless for some reason you wonder why you didn't notice the music and why the tone seems so flawless and flowing. Love it. \r\n \r\nCharacters 9/10: \r\n \r\nCan't spoil much here. Not too many complaints - nice, realistic enough, unique, understandable characters. No wacky ideology, no weird meme beliefs, no dumb tropes, no not-so-dumb tropes, etc. Everyone just feels - *normal. And I think that's wonderful. Love it. \r\n \r\nEnjoyment 10/10: \r\n \r\nIn case anybody reading this couldn't already tell, i Love it. \r\n \r\nOverall 10/10: \r\n \r\nDoes a lot pretty dang well. Falls outside most of the other anime I've watched so far in feel and content, and even a lot of the manga. Its a little hard to believe its an anime but also has such a nostalgic \"anime\" feel. Feel like the 2000's - best period for these kinda shows idk why. \n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

I guess I got “Kill Bill” on the mind when I thought of that title. Anyway, the anime is based on the Japanese manga of the same name by Natsume Ono and serialized in Shogaukan’s seinen magazine Ikki (from 2006-2010). The series is animated by Manglobe, the same company that brought you Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy and this is completely different from any samurai-based anime you seen before. \r\n  \r\n \r\nThe plot or storyline is focused on a samurai named Akitsu Masanosuke, a skilled and loyal swordsman who has no master under him and once again, he was been fired by his lords and start to look for bodyguard jobs and he find one working for a guy named Yaichi, the leader of the gang “Five Leaves”. As he is delve inside the world of the Five Leaves, the more he finds himself fascinated and involved with the people he associates himself with, especially some with many questionable past lives. \r\n  \r\n \r\nYou may wonder if there is going to be any action, thrills, or anything that expect from a samurai anime, well, you might want to keep on looking because it does not fulfill that need that you wanted. \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\nThis is a samurai anime that is character and story driven and whiles the pace of the series does get numbingly slow in the beginning and it still gets that way towards the end and the amount of character development is adequate and well-needed but as for the story development, I never quite understand most of it halfway through the series’ runtime yet in some parts, I could make out some details of it. \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\nThe atmosphere in the series including the main character design of Akitsu comes off as depressing and unenthusiastic, especially the latter. He really just looks like he doesn’t want to be here or just has the same emotionless, expression-less, Keanu Reeves look. However, he isn’t that bad of a character. I’m fine with him not being an all-mighty samurai. Not every character in every form of entertainment (especially Anime) needs to be this powerful character. All the other characters (especially Yaichi) are well-developed and practically carries the show. \r\n  \r\n \r\nThe animation done by Manglobe is non-traditional in character designs and backgrounds and while it looks fascinating to the eyes, it isn’t actually up to par and it can get very tiresome and I sort of gotten sick of that look during the 10th episode. The upbeat opening and ending songs really does contrast from the rest of the show’s bleak and bland tones. \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\nFINAL VERDICT: The show does manage to get story and character development spot-on, it is different than the other anime that is close to this but it is enjoyable to watch? Well, at a time, you can but it has an unbelievably slow pace that can turn off most viewers but a bad show this is not. An underwhelming show it is but would I suggest this? Uhhhhh………I don’t know. This is something you need to figure out for yourself but I can’t help you on this one. \r\n\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

If you are planning to watch this, do not expect fight scene after fight scene (hence subtle). The story is a blend of five characters lives into one storyline that explains how they all met, why they are friends, etc. The character development of this anime is very prominent and one of the best I've seen in a \"basic\" samurai anime. The animation art is different and that can be seen in the characters' faces; it is definitely unique. The show's soundtrack is a mix of present day and classic Japanese music, which I really enjoyed. Also, the sound affects were above average. \r\n \r\nI watched House of Five Leaves in one day and I couldn't stop until I was finished. AGAIN, do not watch this for action, since it is more of a(n) animation/story/character based show. 9/10, I really recommend this show, and since it's only twelve episodes it is very watchable.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

That much is obvious from its odd artwork and animation style. Neither does it aim at being an action samurai anime. Instead, it’s more of a character-centric seinen drama with a strong attention to detail on the characters, their motivations, expressions, actions etc.  Perhaps that is why it is considered ‘slow-moving’; the way the story moves with its characters (rather than the other way round) could put off those who don’t prefer character exposition heavy stories, or those who aren’t able to connect to the characters of the show. Characters are the key here. It’s not about the story, but the people who inhibit it. If you don’t feel involved with the characters, you’ll find the story slow and boring. \r\n  \r\nThe story is about a gang of kidnappers called “five leaves”, with which our main protagonist gets unintentionally involved. We see the story unfold mostly through the eyes of this new member. Masa is new to the Edo, and has desperately tried to cling on to his job as a bodyguard but he always ends up getting fired. On the outside, he looks like a samurai, but the problem is his timid personality; for some reason, Masa does not have enough self-confidence to even survive mildly aggressive social situations, and because of his docile nature has always ended up giving the wrong impression to his employers. It is this timid personality that has him involved with the five leaves, as its leader (yaichi) only needs a bodyguard for show to ensure minimum resistance.  \r\n \r\nAs the show progresses, Masa finds himself playing out a more important role in the gang.  The five leaves have some very interesting group of characters. The leader Yaichi is as cool as ice. Nothing seems to faze him and he always keeps a calm demeanor. But he has a mysterious past, and hardly anyone knows what his motives are. He isn’t doing the kidnappings for money, because he hardly spends the money on himself and seems to throw it around on people he knows. Masa finds this fact very interesting and most of the later half of the show follows him trying to understand Yaichi and his past. Then there’s the barkeeper, Ume, whose tavern is the most common meeting place for the gang and its members. Ume is a honest working man trying to support his daughter (Okinu) with clean earnings, but he has his own reason for being involved with the gang. Then, there’s Matsu, a former thief, and Otake, a local prostitute. All these people appear to be shallow at first, but they all have their own background stories and their own reasons for being involved with the gang, at the center of which is yaichi. \r\n  \r\nIn the beginning, it’s really hard to see what the story is about. You keep getting hit with flashbacks and subtle character expositions via dialogues and character interactions, and it could get a bit confusing. It was not before the fourth episode that I started piecing together the flashbacks and the present events. The show keeps giving you bits and pieces about the people and the gang, and you have to put up the pieces together to understand it. The show is often compared to Mushishi, and I suspect it’s because of this quality and the calm, unusually confident, pace of the anime. Just like an episode of mushishi, the show drops you in the middle of this situation and starts giving you clues, and in the end everything falls together. For that reason the show requires you to be attentive. If you’re an emphatic viewer who always looks for a deeper answer behind the things you see and hear, then this just might be the show for you. \r\n  \r\nThe background art for the anime -whether it be the trees, cherry blossom, the rain, a steaming tea-kettle, the bridge over a river, the houses, walls or the occasional countryside- is just stunning. The art is a bit simple, yet seems detailed; modern, yet fairly traditional. The color palette is deep and strong, and rather pleasing to the eyes. The character designs, however, may not be to everyone’s liking. With big round eyes, lean faces and slits for mouths, character art may turn off some people. Personally, I think the character designs are rather fitting; and if someone can stand those ridiculous moe characters, this should not be a problem. The art is quite detailed in some ways; you can see by looking into those eyes what kind of personality the character has, and all their body language and expressions deliver their emotions perfectly. \r\n  \r\nThe show also delivers well in the sound department. Background music goes well with the situation; some tunes are quite up-beat or buoyant, and some very subdued. The subtle pieces are rather beautiful, some hauntingly so, and all the tracks add a unique ambiance to every scene. The voice actors have done an excellent job, and the background sounds are quite decent. \r\n  \r\nThe calm pace and overall presentation of the show makes it quite relaxing. The show is perfect for someone who wants something soothing to unwind. Although I’d like to put a disclaimer here again, if you don’t like the art or the characters, then there’s good chance you’ll be bored to death instead. But the show is worth a shot just for its unique concept and its imaginative presentation. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\n\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

If you've never heard of Saraiya Goyou, definitely take a moment to see if it's up your alley. \r\n \r\nThe anime follows a strong, innocent, and timid samurai as he joins a enigmatic group in feudal Japan. The interactions between our uncertain protagonist and the group's charismatic leader resemble \"Of Mice and Men.\" Overall, the story focuses on uncovering mystery, loss of innocence, and slow-paced atmosphere. \r\n \r\nOne strength of the anime is that---while it has few action scenes---each of these scenes are crisp and impactful. Characters are nuanced and develop into more complicated individuals over the course of the show. Foreshadowing is well done. The show blends its slow-moving plot with a sense of increasing mystery. \r\n \r\nPerhaps one reason that this anime is not better known is the art style. The plot is slow moving, and it is sometimes unclear where the show is going. The anime does a better job of capturing its characters than telling a story. \r\n \r\nI would recommend this anime to viewers who enjoy slow-paced, introspective anime, or anime that are based on mystery and complex characters. This show is suitable for people in their 20's. \r\n \r\nIf you are looking for more action, or want a positive, uplifting vibe, then I would look elsewhere.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

Masa spends the anime learning about each of the four members (a former geisa, a bar owner, a former robber, and of course the enigmatic leader, Yaichi), and searching his own moral principles to determine whether or not he wants to become the “fifth leaf” of their gang. \r\n \r\nThe unusual art style is probably what makes this anime stand out most: the characters are all animated with very pointy noses and this horrible blankness in their eyes, as if to suggest a kind of existential emptiness, but it’s somewhat misleading, as most of the characters are quite emotional under their own particular moral structures. \r\n \r\nThe slow pace was almost too much for me at first, but I’m glad I stuck it out because I really loved Yaichi with his pale, constantly half-lidded eyes and mysterious backstory, and he has great chemistry with everyone.\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

I'm definitely a biased reviewer, because Lupin is my favorite anime franchise out of everything I've seen, but I really can't express how much I adore it.  Red jacket can really be considered the essence of the Lupin franchise, and is often the one that people think of when anyone says Lupin. \r\n \r\nStory: 10 \r\nPersonally I'm a big fan of episodic type shows, and that's definitely what Lupin is.  The story isn't always captivating or original, because after 155 episodes it becomes impossible to not reuse the same gags, but I really enjoy it just because of the fun, casual writing and the characterization. \r\n \r\nArt: 10 \r\nThe art isn't exactly extraordinary, but it's an older anime- I love it because it lends to the feeling of the show and the franchise, and it really wouldn't be the same any other way. \r\n \r\nSound: 10 \r\nOne of my FAVORITE parts about Lupin. The Lupin VA, especially in this series, do a fantastic job, and Yuji Ohno has been producing music for this franchise the entire time it's been airing- don't get me started on the music scores for the new Italian blue jacket series. It doesn't feel right without Ohno's gorgeous jazz composition, and they're the kind of OSTs I'd listen to in their own right, as music separate from the show. \r\n \r\nCharacters: 10 \r\nThe piece de resistance of Lupin is definitely the characters. Because it's so episodic in nature, the characters are really what set the Lupin franchise apart. I can't say enough about how much I adore all the characters. They are very much stereotypes- a cocky ore-sama type thief, a Girl With Boobs, the best gunman and the best samurai, and a cop- but at the same time, they subvert their stereotypes in a way that makes them all the more engaging. Lupin treasures the loyalty of his friends more than anything, Fujiko has the brains and the brawn to seal the deal, Jigen is a secret romantic, Goemon's biggest weakness is women, and Zenigata loves Lupin to the point where he doesn't want him to die, despite and because of being his greatest rival. The uniqueness of each character in their own right is one of the biggest things that keeps me, personally, coming back. \r\n \r\nEnjoyment & Overall: 10 \r\nI really, really love this series and this franchise. I'd say it's definitely a quality watch, and if you're interested in getting into Lupin but don't know where to start, either this or the 2015 blue jacket series (if you're hesitant about jumping straight in with pre-2000s anime) is a great place to jump off. Before you know it, you'll be like me, downloading every TV special and OST... ;)\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

In my opinion, this is the jumping off point for Lupin. Watch this series fist! When I was first alerted to the Lupin franchise, it was through this series on Adult Swim's late LATE block. They seemed almost awkward about showing this, like, \"Here you go. It looks kind of funny, but it's hilarious. Could you maybe watch it? You know, if that's ok with you. I'll just leave it here where it won't bother you...\" \r\n \r\nA friend told me to watch it and I rolled my eyes.  I was iffy about it based on the strange animation style. And I wasn't too crazy that the show seemed to be just about a thief and an inept detective. But it's far from that.  \r\n \r\nAn inept detective? Well, I suppose that depends on the director or writer. In quite a bit of the first Lupin series Zenigata is a VERY good investigator who just happens to be dealing with someone who is even better. \r\n \r\nSOUND: This series also features some of the best voice acting in an English dub out there. While made in the 1970s-1980s, the references are heavily updated (at least, to when it was released in the early 00s) without seeming intrusive (with the exception of one episode that featured a ridiculous amount of celebrity name dropping). The VA cast is the same cast that went on to voice the video game. They also pronounce the names in the same fashion as the Japanese version and ALL the Lupin songs, which is great. Zenigata's voice is classic, although it borders on foolish instead of a serious detective. Lupin's is iconic, especially with that laugh. I don't know who voiced him better, his original Japanese VA or the English dub. Jigen's is great as well, although Goemon's is better (and less stilted) in later dubs. Fujiko gets the breathy voice that really suits her character and Michelle Ruff has been Fujiko's go to voice actress. \r\n \r\nART: The animation for this series (the red jacket series) is all over the place. While the characters look the same for the most part, when Miyazaki takes over his episodes always have his distinctive look. Also, some episodes have blatant mistakes in animation or sloppy coloring. Others have some very detailed sequences. The style is, of course, skinny and definitely different from most anime you'll see. Monkey Punch had tried to make his style more Western. I'm not sure that comes across in the anime, but it's definitely unique.  While the art is out there, it fits with the manga. I think the style of this series was better than some of the later Lupin specials put out in that two-tone style from the 90s. It definitely takes some getting used to. \r\n \r\nCHARACTER: The issue with this dub vs sub is that some characters come across completely differently. Jigen, in particular, has much more of a sense of humor in the dub. The dub of this series is downright amazing, but we'll get to that later. The manga upon which this anime is based is non-canon, with the characters sometimes not seeming to know each other (or meeting each other for the first time in each chapter under different circumstances). The anime pays a bit of homage to that in terms of some of the cheap disguises, especially when Zenigata can't see through them even when, for instance, Lupin just throws on a fake mustache.  \r\n \r\nSTORY: The creators of the anime have a thing for religion and nazis. So many, many episodes have to do with one or the other. What I love about the Lupin series is that there's almost 200 episodes in the RDJ, plus other series and specials, and very rarely will them be too similar or unimaginative (despite the nazis). Almost every episode has a moment that makes me laugh out loud, and the crimes are usually very creative (even if they don't just bend physics, but destroy them).  \r\n \r\nENJOYMENT: I think Lupin is an anime staple. Watch it. Especially this series. In my opinion, this is the jumping off point for Lupin. Watch this series fist! \r\n \r\n\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",

Its kind of intimidating being the first one to write a review about a classic Anime like Lupin the third Part 2. \r\n \r\nWell lets get onto the review.The plot is about the adventures of famous thief lupin the third and his partners Jigen ( one of the best marksman in the world) Goemon (the samurai and thief that can even cut steel) And Fujiko ( a beautiful thief spy who often betrays Lupin and his partners) There is no real overall story just like Lupin Part 1 its basically episodic unless there is a two part special (which is rare but good). Its more light hearted than the first series and from what I heard also the manga. The first series was kind dark gritty and action packed, but Lupin the Third part two has more humor and a lot more operations based on stealing. It also has some serious moments that make the episodes good. \r\n \r\nThe art is excellent for it time and I think it aged well. You can also tell that some of the newer anime might have gotten some of their inspiration from the character designs notably Lupin and Goemon. Also the background scenery from different places around the world look really good. \r\n \r\nSound. The sound is amazing from the explosions to the car chases everything is done well. The best thing about the sound is the music they Got this Jazz thing going and it works really well for the series and they know how use the music and how to time it. The seiyuus are the best part of the anime, they don't miss a beat and really work well together and take their own character to a new level even some bad episodes are watchable cause of them. \r\n  \r\nThe Characters are best the thing about the series I believe. \r\nLupin The Third- Greatest thief in the world, also really hard to kill and catch. only weakness though is women mainly Fujiko. \r\nDaisuke Jigen- The best marksmen of the group he is also pretty kool himself. He is also doesn't trust Fujiko. \r\nGoemon- The strongest swordsman in the world and he can cut anything even steel. he is very loyal and follows his own honor code. He also doesn't trust Fujiko. \r\nFujiko- A sexy thief, spy and a traitor usually to Lupin. Always looking to get Lupins skills involved and then rip him off. She knows she can get away with it since Lupin is madly in love with her or just really attracted to her. \r\nZenigata- the man that chases Lupin with limited success but never gives up. Always there to make it harder for Lupin and the Gang. \r\nThe kool thing about the characters other than their skills and style is that they have a great bond and have each others backs (even fujiko sometimes) and they rather die than betray each other it really shows in certain episodes. \r\n \r\nI really enjoyed the series but i am not going to lie there are some episodes that flat out bored me but I think it might have to do with the person who directed those certain episodes. The humor is great but I do wish there was more blood and more episodes about people trying assassinate Lupin the Third or one of his Partners. Really enjoyable though if you looking for something to kickback and enjoy some laughs and clever heists and not think to much about. \r\n \r\nOverall i gave it a 9 I easily give high scores and I know that but I resisted giving this a 10 because some episodes were just not that good, but I still gave it a 9 because it is a classic and one of my favorites. \r\n \r\n\n\n          \n \n       Helpful \n   \n      ",
